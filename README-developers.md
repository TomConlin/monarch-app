## Changing Page Layout

For changes to the basic page layout and content that do not require
changing the logic, find the relevant mustache template in the
templates directory and make the changes there. This requires no
programming. The changes should take effect immediately without you
having to restart the server.

## Data tables

Tables are generated from a Solr index of the Monarch Data SciGraph Instance.
We interact with the Solr index using the GOlr API, for example,
the GOlr [Response](https://berkeleybop.github.io/bbop-js/docs/files/golr/response-js.html) and
[Manager](https://berkeleybop.github.io/bbop-js/docs/files/golr/manager-js.html) classes.

Tables are created using the bbop golr widget, see the
[Live Results Widget](https://berkeleybop.github.io/bbop-js/docs/files/widget/live_results-js.html) for API docs.

### Adding tables to a page

The current approach is to break data into individual tables stored in various tabs.  The long term
goal is to display data in a single large table, see the [issue](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/monarch-app/issues/723)
with adding logical OR filter to GOlr.

Adding a new table requires adding 5 lines to webapp.js and adding 2 lines to the mustache template;
for example, to add disease phenotype associations to a disease page:

        webapp.js

        var phenotype_filter = [
                                {
                                    field: 'object_category',
                                    value: 'phenotype'
                                }
        ];

        # Add the table where the second parameter is where we filter out the disease ID, typically either
        # object_closure or subject_closure, in this case the disease ID is filtered via the subject_closure
        addGolrTable(info, "subject_closure", id, 'phenotypes-table', phenotype_filter, 'generic_association');

        # Server side query to get the result counts
        info.phenotypeNum = engine.fetchAssociationCount(id, 'subject_closure', phenotype_filter);

        # Add the mustache templates to the info object
        info.includes.phenotype_anchor = addPhenotypeAnchor(info);
        info.includes.phenotype_table = addPhenotypeTable();

Then in the mustache template, add the anchor to categories div

        disease.mustache

        <div id="categories">
            {{{includes.phenotype_anchor}}}
        </div>

Then add the table to the complete-info div

        disease.mustache

        <div id="complete-info">
            {{{includes.phenotype_table}}}
        </div>

Note: in some cases a new data association will require making new functions to serialize the table and anchor html templates.
New functions can be made by following this format:

        webapp.js

        function addPhenotypeAnchor(info) {
            var phenotype_anchor = {id: info.id,
                                    resultNum: info.phenotypeNum,
                                    type: "Phenotypes", href: "phenotypes"};
            return Mustache.to_html(getTemplate('anchor'), phenotype_anchor);
        }

        function addPhenotypeTable() {
            var phenotype_table = {href: "phenotypes", div: "phenotypes-table"};
            return Mustache.to_html(getTemplate('golr-table'), phenotype_table);
        }

### Adding a new GOlr view

A GOlr view can be configured via a yaml file; for example, the generic_association view
is defined [here](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/monarch-app/blob/master/conf/golr-views/oban-config.yaml).

New views can be defined using this format.  Change the ID propery and pass this to the
addGolrTable() function in webapp.js function as the 6th parameter.

### Merging two yaml files to create a new GOlr view

There are many cases where we want to use a GOlr view as a base and update the filters,
column names, order, description, etc.  To do this, create a new yaml file with properties
that you would like to override and then merge using the MergeYamlConf.pl script.  Or simply
add the new yaml file to the [single-tab directory](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/monarch-app/tree/master/conf/golr-views/single-tab)
and run the shell wrapper merge-all-config.sh

For example, see the [disease-phenotype.yaml](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/monarch-app/blob/master/conf/golr-views/single-tab/disease-phenotype.yaml)
which overrides values in the [oban-config.yaml file](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/monarch-app/blob/master/conf/golr-views/oban-config.yaml)
These are merged by running:

        perl ./MergeYamlConf.pl --input ../conf/golr-views/single-tab/disease-phenotype.yaml.yaml --reference ../conf/golr-views/oban-config.yaml --output ../conf/golr-views/disease-phenotype-oban-config.yaml


## Adding new datatypes

### Note: the "Adding new datatypes" section applies to legacy pages and will be deprecated with the next release

Let's say we have ingested a new resource and created a new view using
the NIF DISCO system. We wish to expose this in the app, let's say in
the disease page.

### Extend the API

We first add a new low-level API call to api.js. Clone an existing
method (e.g. fetchOmimDiseasePhenotypeAsAssocations), and modify:

 * The ID of the view (e.g. nlx_12345_1)
 * The callback function used to translate the flat tuple into a nested json object

Then add a call to your new method to fetchDiseaseInfo (assuming the
new view provides disease related data), or to any of the other
high-level API calls.

### Map to RDF (optional)

Currently this is not required as the application is not driven by the
RDF, but it is good practice to ensure that the JSON model you come up
with in the API is extensible, uses good ID practice and easily mapped
to RDF.

The mapping is achieved by editing the JSON-LD @context tag. See
getJsonLdContext() at the end of api.js. Currently there is one
monolithic context for all of Monarch but in future this may be
modularized.

## Create a widget

Open widgets.js and create a new widget for displaying your data. This
is typically a table but could be anything. Clone an existing function.

### Register the widget

In webapp.js, find the relevant path (e.g. /disease/:id) and register.

Let's say you are adding "stuff" to the disease page, and the widget
you created is called genTableOfMyStuff, and your API extension adds
an extra associative array or list to the disease object keyed by
'stuff':

    info.myStuff = function() {return genTableOfMyStuff(info.stuff)} ;

### Modify the template

Assuming you are adding to the disease page, add an html div like the
following:

   <div id="stuff"
    <table>
     {{{myStuff}}}
    </table>
   </div>

If you want to add a download json/rdf button, see other examples in
the template.

### Restart the server

Kill the server and restart:

    ./start-server.sh

That's it!
