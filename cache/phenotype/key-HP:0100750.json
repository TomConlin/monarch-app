This protein is primarily involved in oxidative metabolism of xenobiotics and is capable of metabolically activating numerous procarcinogens including aflatoxin B1, arylamines, heterocyclic amine food mutagens, and polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons. Expression of CYP1A2 is induced after exposure to certain aromatic hydrocarbons (i.e., 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin). Direct evidence for a role of CYP1A2 in any physiological or developmental pathway has not been documented. We now demonstrate that mice homozygous for a targeted mutation in the Cyp1a-2 gene are nonviable. Lethality occurs shortly after birth with symptoms of severe respiratory distress. Mutant neonates display impaired respiratory function associated with histological signs of lung immaturity, lack of air in alveoli at birth, and changes in expression of surfactant apoprotein in alveolar type II cells. The penetrance of the phenotype is not complete (19 mutants survived to adulthood out of 599 mice). Surviving animals, although lacking expression of CYP1A2, appear to be normal and are able to reproduce. These findings establish that CYP1A2 is critical for neonatal survival by influencing the physiology of respiration in neonates, thus offering etiological insights for neonatal respiratory distress syndrome.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"17121831","pmcid":null,"title":"Respiratory distress and neonatal lethality in mice lacking Golgi alpha1,2-mannosidase IB involved in N-glycan maturation.","authors":["Tremblay LO","Nagy Kovács E","Daniels E","Wong NK","Sutton-Smith M","Morris HR","Dell A","Marcinkiewicz E","Seidah NG","McKerlie C","Herscovics A"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":["Wellcome Trust"],"retractions":[],"journal":"The Journal of biological chemistry","journalShort":"J.

Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization indicate that the three paralogs display distinct developmental and tissue-specific expression. The physiological role of Golgi alpha1,2-mannosidase IB was investigated by targeted gene ablation. The null mice have normal gross appearance at birth, but they display respiratory distress and die within a few hours. Histology of fetal lungs the day before birth indicate some delay in development, whereas neonatal lungs show extensive pulmonary hemorrhage in the alveolar region. No significant histopathological changes occur in other tissues. No remarkable ultrastructural differences are detected between wild type and null lungs. The membranes of a subset of bronchiolar epithelial cells are stained with lectins from Phaseolus vulgaris (leukoagglutinin and erythroagglutinin) and Datura stramonium in wild type lungs, but this staining disappears in lungs from null mice. Mass spectrometry of N-glycans from different tissues shows no significant changes in global N-glycans of null mice. Therefore, only a few glycoproteins required for normal lung function depend on alpha1,2-mannosidase IB for maturation. There are no apparent differences in the expression of several lung epithelial cell and endothelial cell markers between null and wild type mice. The alpha1,2-mannosidase IB null phenotype differs from phenotypes caused by ablation of other enzymes in N-glycan biosynthesis and from other mouse gene disruptions that affect pulmonary development and function.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"16055928","pmcid":null,"title":"RPGR is mutated in patients with a complex X linked phenotype combining primary ciliary dyskinesia and retinitis pigmentosa.","authors":["Moore A","Escudier E","Roger G","Tamalet A","Pelosse B","Marlin S","Clément A","Geremek M","Delaisi B","Bridoux AM","Coste A","Witt M","Duriez B","Amselem S"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Journal of medical genetics","journalShort":"J.

To date, only two autosomal genes, DNAI1 and DNAH5 encoding axonemal dynein chains, have been shown to cause PCD with defective outer dynein arms. Here, we investigated one non-consanguineous family in which a woman with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) gave birth to two boys with a complex phenotype combining PCD, discovered in early childhood and characterised by partial dynein arm defects, and RP that occurred secondarily. The family history prompted us to search for an X linked gene that could account for both conditions. RESULTS: We found perfect segregation of the disease phenotype with RP3 associated markers (Xp21.1). Analysis of the retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator gene (RPGR) located at this locus revealed a mutation (631_IVS6+9del) in the two boys and their mother. As shown by study of RPGR transcripts expressed in nasal epithelial cells, this intragenic deletion, which leads to activation of a cryptic donor splice site, predicts a severely truncated protein. CONCLUSION: These data provide the first clear demonstration of X linked transmission of PCD. This unusual mode of inheritance of PCD in patients with particular phenotypic features (that is, partial dynein arm defects and association with RP), which should modify the current management of families affected by PCD or RP, unveils the importance of RPGR in the proper development of both respiratory ciliary structures and connecting cilia of photoreceptors.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"17267394","pmcid":null,"title":"ABCA3 as a lipid transporter in pulmonary surfactant biogenesis.","authors":["Ban N","Matsumura Y","Sakai H","Takanezawa Y","Sasaki M","Arai H","Inagaki N"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"The Journal of biological chemistry","journalShort":"J.

Full-term Abca3(-/-) newborn pups died within an hour after birth because of acute respiratory failure. Ultrastructural analysis revealed abnormally dense lamellar body-like organelles and no normal lamellar bodies in Abca3(-/-) alveolar type II cells. TLC and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analyses of lipids in the pulmonary interstitium showed that phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol, which contain palmitic acid and are abundant in normal surfactant lipids, were dramatically decreased in Abca3(-/-) lung.

Lrp4 is expressed in multiple tissues in the mouse, and is important for the proper development and morphogenesis of limbs, ectodermal organs, lungs and kidneys. We show that Lrp4 is also expressed in the post-synaptic endplate region of muscles and is required to form neuromuscular synapses. Lrp4-mutant mice die at birth with defects in both presynaptic and postsynaptic differentiation, including aberrant motor axon growth and branching, a lack of acetylcholine receptor and postsynaptic protein clustering, and a failure to express postsynaptic genes selectively by myofiber synaptic nuclei. Our data show that Lrp4 is required during the earliest events in postsynaptic neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation and suggest that it acts in the early, nerveindependent steps of NMJ assembly. The identification of Lrp4 as a crucial factor for NMJ formation may have implications for human neuromuscular diseases such as myasthenia syndromes.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"7759497","pmcid":null,"title":"COOH-terminal disruption of lipoprotein lipase in mice is lethal in homozygotes, but heterozygotes have elevated triglycerides and impaired enzyme activity.","authors":["Coleman T","Seip RL","Gimble JM","Lee D","Maeda N","Semenkovich CF"],"grantIds":["CA50898","HL42630","HL47436"],"grantAgencies":["NCI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"The Journal of biological chemistry","journalShort":"J.

Pups homozygous (-/-) for LPL deficiency died within 48 h of birth with extreme elevations of serum triglycerides (13,327 mg/dl) associated with essentially absent LPL enzyme activity in heart and carcass. Newborn heterozygous (+/-) LPL-deficient pups had lower LPL enzyme activity and higher triglycerides (370 versus 121 mg/dl) than wild type (+/+) littermates. Adult heterozygotes had higher triglycerides than wild type mice with ad libitum feeding (236 mg/dl for +/- versus 88 mg/dl for +/+) and after fasting for 4 h (98 mg/dl for +/- versus 51 for +/+) or 12 h (109 mg/dl for +/- versus 56 mg/dl for +/+). Triglycerides were present as very low density lipoprotein particles and chylomicrons, but high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were not decreased in +/- animals. Plasma heparin-releasable LPL activity was 43% lower in +/- versus +/+ adult animals. LPL activity, mRNA, and protein were lower in the tissues of +/- versus +/+ mice. Homozygous LPL deficiency caused by disruption of the COOH terminus of the enzyme is lethal in mice. Heterozygous LPL deficiency caused by this mutation is associated with mild to moderate hypertriglyceridemia without affecting static HDL cholesterol levels. Heterozygous LPL-deficient mice could be useful for determining if hypertriglyceridemia, independently or in combination with other discrete defects, influences atherosclerosis.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"9177246","pmcid":null,"title":"Cleft palate and decreased brain gamma-aminobutyric acid in mice lacking the 67-kDa isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase.","authors":["Asada H","Kawamura Y","Maruyama K","Kume H","Ding RG","Kanbara N","Kuzume H","Sanbo M","Yagi T","Obata K"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","journalShort":"Proc.

To determine the role of Dmrt2 during mouse embryonic development, we generated a null mutation of Dmrt2 via homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Dmrt2 heterozygous mice derived from these cells are phenotypically normal. However, Dmrt2 homozygotes die soon after birth. The cause of death is likely due to abnormal rib and sternal development, leading to an inability to breathe. Loss of Dmrt2 leads to embryonic somite patterning defects, first evidenced at embryonic day (E) 10.5 and more pronounced by E11.5. Notably, both the dermomyotome and myotome fail to adopt a normal epithelial morphology in the absence of Dmrt2. Accompanying these morphological defects are alterations in the expression patterns of dermomyotomal and myotomal transcription factors including Pax3, Paraxis, Myf5, myogenin, Mrf4 and MyoD. Despite these defects, embryos harvested from E13.5 onwards exhibited relatively normal muscle pattern and mass, suggesting that early myotomal defects are corrected by a Dmrt2-independent mechanism.

Tissue blots found ABCA3 expression was highest in lung but was also detectable in other tissues, including the kidney. Gross development of kidney and lung was normal in neonatal Abca3(-/-) pups, but the mice failed to inflate their lungs, leading to death from atelectatic respiratory failure. Ultrastructural analysis of the Abca3(-/-) lungs revealed an absence of surfactant from the alveolar space and a profound loss of mature lamellar bodies, the intracellular storage organelle for surfactant. Mass spectrometry measurement of >300 phospholipids in lung tissue taken from Abca3(-/-) mice showed a dramatic reduction of phosphatidylglycerol (PG) levels as well as selective reductions in phosphatidylcholine species containing short acyl chains.

Gene deletions in budding and fission yeasts and knock-down experiments with the worm have not revealed any clear in vivo requirements for p23. We find that p23 is not essential for overall prenatal development and morphogenesis of the mouse, which parallels the observation that it is dispensable for proliferation in yeast. In contrast, p23 is absolutely necessary for perinatal survival. Apart from an incompletely formed skin barrier, the lungs of p23 null embryos display underdeveloped airspaces and substantially reduced expression of surfactant genes. Correlating with the known function of glucocorticoids in promoting lung maturation and the role of p23 in the assembly of a hormone-responsive glucocorticoid receptor-Hsp90 complex, p23 null fibroblast cells have a defective glucocorticoid response.

Megalin knockout mice manifest abnormalities in epithelial tissues including lung and kidney that normally express the protein and they die perinatally from respiratory insufficiency. In brain, impaired proliferation of neuroepithelium produces a holoprosencephalic syndrome, characterized by lack of olfactory bulbs, forebrain fusion, and a common ventricular system.

Although the UPR is activated under diverse pathological conditions, its physiological role during development and in adulthood has not been fully elucidated. Binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) is an ER chaperone, which is central to ER function. We produced knock-in mice expressing a mutant BiP lacking the retrieval sequence to cause a defect in ER function without completely eliminating BiP. In embryonic fibroblasts, the UPR compensated for mutation of BiP. However, neonates expressing mutant BiP suffered respiratory failure due to impaired secretion of pulmonary surfactant by alveolar type II epithelial cells. Expression of surfactant protein (SP)-C was reduced and the lamellar body was malformed, indicating that BiP plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of pulmonary surfactant. Because pulmonary surfactant requires extensive post-translational processing in the secretory pathway, these findings suggest that in secretory cells, such as alveolar type II cells, the UPR is essential for managing the normal physiological ER protein overload that occurs during development. Moreover, failure of this adaptive mechanism may increase pulmonary susceptibility to environmental insults, such as hypoxia and ischemia, ultimately leading to neonatal respiratory failure.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"10402191","pmcid":null,"title":"Alternatively spliced isoforms of nerve- and muscle-derived agrin: their roles at the neuromuscular junction.","authors":["Burgess RW","Nguyen QT","Son YJ","Lichtman JW","Sanes JR"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Neuron","journalShort":"Neuron","day":29,"month":5,"year":1999,"meshHeadings":["Agrin","Alternative Splicing","Animals","Chick Embryo","Chimera","Coculture Techniques","Mice","Mice, Mutant Strains","Muscles","Mutation","Nerve Tissue","Neuromuscular Junction","Protein Isoforms"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Agrin induces synaptic differentiation at the skeletal neuromuscular junction (NMJ); both pre- and postsynaptic differentiation are drastically impaired in its absence.

In wild-type embryonic renal tract explants, exogenous BMP4 upregulated Tshz3 and myocardin expression. More interestingly, in Tshz3 mutant renal tract explants, exogenous BMP4 did not improve the Tshz3 phenotype.

We generated T1alpha null mutant mice to study the role of T1alpha in lung development and differentiation and to gain insight into its potential function. Homozygous null mice die at birth of respiratory failure, and their lungs cannot be inflated to normal volumes. Distal lung morphology is altered.

In these mice, TH activity in the embryos and adult tissues was less than 50% of the wild-type values, but the catecholamine level was decreased only moderately in the developing animals and was maintained normally at adulthood, suggesting the presence of a regulatory mechanism for ensuring the proper catecholamine level during animal development. In contrast, the homozygous mutant mice died at a late stage of embryonic development or shortly after birth. Both TH mRNA and enzyme activity were lacking in the homozygous mutants, which thus explained the severe depletion of catecholamines. These changes, however, did not affect gross morphological development of the cells that normally express high catecholamine levels. Analysis of electrocardiograms of surviving newborn mutants showed bradycardia, suggesting an alteration of cardiac functions in the homozygous mice that may lead to the lethality of this mutation. In addition, transfer of a human TH transgene into the homozygous mice corrected the mutant phenotype, showing recovery of TH activity by expression of the human enzyme. These results indicate that TH is essential for survival of the animals during the late gestational development and after birth.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"12682084","pmcid":"2172877","title":"Abnormal neurofilament transport caused by targeted disruption of neuronal kinesin heavy chain KIF5A.","authors":["Xia CH","Roberts EA","Her LS","Liu X","Williams DS","Cleveland DW","Goldstein LS"],"grantIds":["GM35252","R01 EY007042","R37 NS027036"],"grantAgencies":["NIGMS NIH HHS","NEI NIH HHS","NINDS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"The Journal of cell biology","journalShort":"J.

Normal fetal lung development and alveolar cell differentiation is regulated by a network of transcription factors. Functional loss of any of these factors will alter the developmental program and impact surfactant production and normal gas exchange. During development, the fetus is exposed to varying oxygen concentrations and must be able to quickly adapt to these changes in order to survive. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) is the primary transcription factor that is responsible for regulating the cellular response to changes in oxygen tension and is essential for normal development. Its role in lung maturation is not well defined and to address this knowledge gap, a lung-specific HIF1alpha knock-out model has been developed. Loss of HIF1alpha early in lung development leads to pups that die within hours of parturition, exhibiting symptoms similar to RDS. Lungs from these pups display impaired alveolar epithelial differentiation and an almost complete loss of surfactant protein expression. Ultrastructural analysis of lungs from HIF1alpha deletion pups had high levels of glycogen, aberrant septal development, and decreased expression of several factors necessary for proper lung development, including HIF2alpha, beta-catenin, and vascular endothelial growth factor. These results suggest that HIF1alpha is essential for proper lung maturation and alteration in its normal signaling during premature delivery might explain the pathophysiology of neonatal RDS.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"7670465","pmcid":null,"title":"Adenosine-deaminase-deficient mice die perinatally and exhibit liver-cell degeneration, atelectasis and small intestinal cell death.","authors":["Migchielsen AA","Breuer ML","van Roon MA","te Riele H","Zurcher C","Ossendorp F","Toutain S","Hershfield MS","Berns A","Valerio D"],"grantIds":["DK20902"],"grantAgencies":["NIDDK NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Nature genetics","journalShort":"Nat.

To rigorously assess suggested roles, we have generated Dppa4-deficient and Dppa4/Dppa2 doubly deficient ES cells, as well as mice lacking Dppa4.

Moreover, the mutant type II cells were compromised for Ca(2+) release mediated by inositol-trisphosphate receptors, despite Ca(2+) overloading in intracellular stores. Our results indicate that TRIC-B channels take an active part in Ca(2+) signalling to establish specialised functions in type II cells and are thus essential for perinatal lung maturation.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"12591604","pmcid":null,"title":"Developmental cooperation of leukemia inhibitory factor and insulin-like growth factor I in mice is tissue-specific and essential for lung maturation involving the transcription factors Sp3 and TTF-1.","authors":["Pichel JG","Fernández-Moreno C","Vicario-Abejón C","Testillano PS","Patterson PH","de Pablo F"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Mechanisms of development","journalShort":"Mech.

It exerts its functions through endocrine, paracrine or autocrine mechanisms. Circulating IGF-1 is essential for normal fetal and postnatal growth, although the published phenotypes of IGF-1 null animals have been only partially penetrant, presumably due to mixed genetic backgrounds. Molecular dissection of IGF-1 action is complicated by the existence of at least nine different IGF-1 isoforms, generated in both humans and rodents by usage of alternate promoters, differential splicing and different post-translational modifications. Several lines of evidence suggest that the Class 2 IGF-1 isoform is specifically destined for circulation, supporting an endocrine role of IGF-1 in normal growth processes. Using Cre/LoxP conditional gene targeting of exon 2 of the IGF-1 gene, we have generated a Class 2 IGF-1 knockout mouse line in a pure C57/Bl6 genetic background, where the specific removal of exon 2 ablated Class 2 IGF-1 isoform. Class 2 IGF-1 knockout mice exhibited normal development and postnatal growth patterns and had normal IGF-1 circulating levels, due to compensatory upregulation of Class 1 transcripts. In contrast, progeny of a total IGF-1 knockout line lacking exon 3 in the same genetic background were predictably smaller, displayed dramatically reduced IGF-1 receptor phosphorylation and all died perinatally, apparently due to respiratory failure.

Previous studies have shown a strict dependence on the choline cytidylyltransferase alpha isoform (CCTalpha) to mediate membrane phospholipid formation in cultured cells and during preimplantation embryogenesis. CCTalpha expression is highest in lung, and there has long been speculation about its precise role, due to the dual requirement for phospholipid in proliferating cell membranes and for lung surfactant production from alveolar type II cells. We investigated the function of CCTalpha in lung development, using an inducible, epithelial cell-specific CCTalpha knockout mouse line. Deletion of CCTalpha beginning at embryonic day 7.5 did not restrict lung development but resulted in severe respiratory failure at birth. Alveolar lavage and lung lipid analyses showed significant decreases in the major surfactant phospholipid, dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine. The fatty acids destined for the surfactant phospholipid were redirected to an expanded triglyceride pool. Transcripts encoding type II cell-specific markers were expressed in the knockout mice, indicating the expected progression of differentiation in lung epithelia. However, surfactant protein levels were reduced, with the exception of that for surfactant protein B, which was elevated. Ultrastructural analysis of the type II cells showed Golgi complex abnormalities and aberrant lamellar bodies, which deliver surfactant lipid and protein to the alveolar lumen. Thus, CCTalpha was not required for the proliferation or differentiation of lung epithelia but was essential for the secretory component of phospholipid synthesis and critical for the proper formation of lamellar bodies and surfactant protein homeostasis.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"9205141","pmcid":null,"title":"Impaired lung branching morphogenesis in the absence of functional EGF receptor.","authors":["Miettinen PJ","Warburton D","Bu D","Zhao JS","Berger JE","Minoo P","Koivisto T","Allen L","Dobbs L","Werb Z","Derynck R"],"grantIds":["CA54826","CA57621","HD26732"],"grantAgencies":["NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NICHD NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Developmental biology","journalShort":"Dev.

Neonatal EGF-receptor-deficient mice often show evidence of lung immaturity which can result in visible respiratory distress. The lungs of these mutant mice had impaired branching and deficient alveolization and septation, resulting in a 50% reduction in alveolar volume and, thus, a markedly reduced surface for gas exchange. The EGF-receptor inactivation also resulted in type II pneumocyte immaturity, which was apparent from their increased glycogen content and a reduced number of lamellar bodies. The defective branching was already evident at Day 12 of embryonic development. When explants of embryonic lungs from Day 12 embryos were cultured under defined conditions, the branching defect in EGF-receptor-deficient lungs was even more pronounced, with only half as many terminal buds as normal lungs. EGF treatment stimulated the expression of surfactant protein C and thyroid transcription factor-1 in cultured normal lungs, but not in EGF-receptor-deficient lungs, suggesting that EGF-receptor signaling regulates the expression of these marker genes during type II pneumocyte maturation. Taken together, our data indicate that signal transduction through the EGF receptor plays a major role in lung development and that its inactivation leads to a respiratory distress-like syndrome.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"17003488","pmcid":null,"title":"Impact of the loss of Hoxa5 function on lung alveogenesis.","authors":["Mandeville I","Aubin J","LeBlanc M","Lalancette-Hébert M","Janelle MF","Tremblay GM","Jeannotte L"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"The American journal of pathology","journalShort":"Am.

We now show that the loss of Hoxa5 function has severe repercussions on postnatal lung development. Hoxa5-/- lungs present an emphysema-like morphology because of impaired alveogenesis. Chronic inflammation characteristics, including goblet cell hyperplasia, mucus hypersecretion, and recruitment of inflammatory cells, were also observed. Altered cell specification during lung morphogenesis triggered goblet cell anomalies. In addition, the defective motility of alveolar myofibroblast precursors in the embryonic lung led to the mispositioning of the alveolar myofibroblasts and to abnormal elastin deposition postnatally. Both goblet cell hyperplasia and elastic fiber abnormalities contributed to the chronic physiopathological features of Hoxa5-/- lungs. They constituted an attractive stimulus to recruit activated macrophages that in turn generated a positive feedback loop that perpetuated macrophage accumulation in the lung. The present work corroborates the notion that altered Hox gene expression may predispose to lung pathologies.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"10469569","pmcid":null,"title":"The Wilms tumor suppressor gene wt1 is required for development of the spleen.","authors":["Herzer U","Crocoll A","Barton D","Howells N","Englert C"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Current biology : CB","journalShort":"Curr.

On a C57BL/6 genetic background, wt1(-/-) animals die between day 13.5 (E13.5) and 15.5 (E15.5) of embryonic development [7].

The expression of hox11, a gene that also controls development of the spleen [8] [9], was not altered by the inactivation of wt1.

In contrast to previous findings of YAP (Yes-associated protein)-mediated canonical Hippo signaling in the liver and intestine, loss of Mst1/2 kinases induced the defects in pneumocyte differentiation independently of YAP hyperactivity.

The close linkage of OVCA1 and p53 on human Chromosome 17 suggests that coordinated loss may be an important mechanism for the evolution of ovarian, breast, and other tumor phenotypes.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"19769957","pmcid":null,"title":"The role of integrin alpha8beta1 in fetal lung morphogenesis and injury.","authors":["Benjamin JT","Gaston DC","Halloran BA","Schnapp LM","Zent R","Prince LS"],"grantIds":["CA68485","DK20593","DK58404","DK59637","EY08126","HD15052","P01 DK65123","R01 DK069921","R01 DK075594","R01 HL086324","R01 HL086324","R01 HL086324-01A2"],"grantAgencies":["NCI NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NEI NIH HHS","NICHD NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Developmental biology","journalShort":"Dev.

In this study we show that expression of the fibronectin receptor, integrin alpha8beta1 is decreased in the lung mesenchyme in the same inflammation model suggesting it is required for normal lung development. We verified a role for integrin alpha8beta1 in lung development using integrin alpha8-null mice, which develop fusion of the medial and caudal lobes as well as abnormalities in airway division. We further show in vivo and in vitro that alpha8-null fetal lung mesenchymal cells fail to form stable adhesions and have increased migration.

Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine whether α(2B)-adrenoceptors are also involved in other developmental processes beyond placental angiogenesis. Ablation of α(2B)-adrenoceptors led to lethality of mutant mice during the first hours after birth. Despite normal breathing and drinking behavior, mutant mice developed cyanosis, which could be traced back to a defect in lung morphology with significantly reduced alveolar volume and thickened interalveolar septi. In α(2B)-deficient lungs and in isolated alveolar type II cells, expression of sonic hedgehog (SHH) was significantly increased, resulting in mesenchymal proliferation. In vitro α(2B)-adrenoreceptor stimulation suppressed expression of sonic hedgehog and the cell cycle genes cyclin D1 and Ki67. In vivo inhibition of enhanced SHH signaling by the smoothened antagonist cyclopamine partially rescued perinatal lethality, lung morphology, and altered gene expression in mutant mice. Thus, α(2B)-adrenoceptors in lung epithelia play an important role in suppressing sonic hedgehog-mediated proliferation of mesenchymal cells and thus prevent respiratory failure.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"21518954","pmcid":null,"title":"SWI/SNF complexes containing Brahma or Brahma-related gene 1 play distinct roles in smooth muscle development.","authors":["Zhang M","Chen M","Kim JR","Zhou J","Jones RE","Tune JD","Kassab GS","Metzger D","Ahlfeld S","Conway SJ","Herring BP"],"grantIds":["DK61130","HL60714"],"grantAgencies":["NIDDK NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Molecular and cellular biology","journalShort":"Mol.

However, more recent work has suggested that ANP32B may in fact have functions that are not shared by other ANP32 family members.

Further examination reveals that the respiratory distress and atelectasis occur in the homozygous mutants. The maturation of lung and alveolar epithelium is delayed in the mutant, as indicated by narrowed air spaces, thickened interstitial septa, and increased glycogen content in the lungs of Stk40(-/-) mice. The reduction in levels of T1-α, SP-B, and SP-C indicates delayed maturation of both type I and type II respiratory epithelial cells in Stk40(-/-) lungs. Moreover, Stk40 is found to be most highly expressed in lungs of both fetal and adult mice among all organs tested. Mechanistically, a genome-wide RNA microarray analysis reveals significantly altered expression of multiple genes known to participate in lung development. The expression of some genes involved in lipid metabolism, immune response, and glycogen metabolism is also disrupted in the lung of Stk40(-/-) mice. Protein affinity purification identifies RCN2, an activator of ERK/MAPK signaling, as an STK40-associated protein. Consistently, Stk40 deficiency attenuates the ERK/MAPK activation, and inhibition of ERK/MAPK activities reduces surfactant protein gene expression in lung epithelial cells.

Murine Hat1 is essential for viability, as homozygous deletion of Hat1 results in neonatal lethality.

To further our understanding of the developmental and neurological processes that underlie the pathophysiology of this disorder, we have developed a mouse model of RSH/SLOS by disruption of the 3 beta-hydroxysterol Delta(7)-reductase gene.

As in human patients, the RSH/SLOS mouse has a marked reduction of serum and tissue cholesterol levels and a marked increase of serum and tissue 7-dehydrocholesterol levels. Phenotypic similarities between this mouse model and the human syndrome include intra-uterine growth retardation, variable craniofacial anomalies including cleft palate, poor feeding with an uncoordinated suck, hypotonia and decreased movement. Neurophysiological studies showed that although the response of frontal cortex neurons to the neurotransmitter gamma-amino-n-butyric acid was normal, the response of these same neurons to glutamate was significantly impaired.

Using PCR, we identified a transposon insertion site in the first intron of Nmnat2 (Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenyltransferase 2). Nmnat2 is expressed predominantly in the brain and nervous system and has been linked to the survival of axons. Expression of this gene is undetectable in Nmnat2(blad/blad) mutants. Examination of the brains of E18.5 Nmnat2(blad/blad) mutant embryos did not reveal any obvious morphological changes.

It appears that in the absence of Nmnat2, major target organs and tissues (e.g., muscle) are not functionally innervated resulting in perinatal lethality.
