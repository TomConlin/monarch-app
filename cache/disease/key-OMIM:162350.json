It belongs to a group of progressive neurodegenerative diseases characterized by accumulation of intracellular autofluorescent lipopigment storage material in the brain and other tissues. Several different forms have been described according to age of onset (see, e.g., CLN3, OMIM:204200). Individuals with the adult form, sometimes referred to as Kufs disease, develop psychiatric manifestations, seizures, cerebellar ataxia, and cognitive decline. Retinal degeneration is usually not present (summary by {2:Benitez et al., 2011} and {13:Velinov et al., 2012}).nnFor a general phenotypic description and a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of CLN, see CLN1 (OMIM:256730)."],"id":"OMIM:162350","label":"CLN4B

The genetic and molecular basis of the disease has remained unknown for many years. We carried out linkage mapping, gene-expression analysis, exome sequencing, and candidate-gene sequencing in affected individuals from 20 families and/or individuals with simplex cases; we identified in five individuals one of two disease-causing mutations, c.346_348delCTC and c.344T>G, in DNAJC5 encoding cysteine-string protein alpha (CSPα). These mutations-causing a deletion, p.Leu116del, and an amino acid exchange, p.Leu115Arg, respectively-are located within the cysteine-string domain of the protein and affect both palmitoylation-dependent sorting and the amount of CSPα in neuronal cells. The resulting depletion of functional CSPα might cause in parallel the presynaptic dysfunction and the progressive neurodegeneration observed in affected individuals and lysosomal accumulation of misfolded and proteolysis-resistant proteins in the form of characteristic ceroid deposits in neurons. Our work represents an important step in the genetic dissection of a genetically heterogeneous group of ANCLs. It also confirms a neuroprotective role for CSPα in humans and demonstrates the need for detailed investigation of CSPα in the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses and other neurodegenerative diseases presenting with neuronal protein aggregation.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"11489285","pmcid":null,"title":"Autosomal dominant Kufs' disease: a cause of early onset dementia.","authors":["Josephson SA","Schmidt RE","Millsap P","McManus DQ","Morris JC"],"grantIds":["AG03991","AG05681"],"grantAgencies":["NIA NIH HHS","NIA NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Journal of the neurological sciences","journalShort":"J.

We report a third family with apparent autosomal dominant Kufs' disease in a family of English ancestry. Ten individuals (five men, five women) have been affected over five generations. Age of onset typically is in the fourth decade of life and is heralded by seizures. Clinical and neuropsychological assessments in several affected individuals, however, confirm the presence of dementia and follow-up evaluations suggest that dementia is the primary disabling feature of the illness. Motor abnormalities also are frequent. Neuropathological examination (three cases) documents the presence of neuronal lipopigment accumulation consistent with NCL. The combination of dementia and seizures in this and two other reported families with autosomal dominant Kufs' disease suggest that this entity represents a distinctive clinicopathological entity. Dementia is prominent but is almost always associated with generalized seizures and motoric disturbances early in the disease course.

A novel single-nucleotide variation (c.344T>G) in the DNAJC5 gene was identified. Mutational screening in an independent family with autosomal dominant ANCL found an in-frame single codon deletion (c.346_348 delCTC) resulting in a deletion of p.Leu116del. These variants fulfill all genetic criteria for disease-causing mutations: they are found in unrelated families with the same disease, exhibit complete segregation between the mutation and the disease, and are absent in healthy controls. In addition, the associated amino acid substitutions are located in evolutionarily highly conserved residues and are predicted to functionally affect the encoded protein (CSPα). The mutations are located in a cysteine-string domain, which is required for membrane targeting/binding, palmitoylation, and oligomerization of CSPα. We performed a comprehensive in silico analysis of the functional and structural impact of both mutations on CSPα. We found that these mutations dramatically decrease the affinity of CSPα for the membrane. We did not identify any significant effect on palmitoylation status of CSPα. However, a reduction of CSPα membrane affinity may change its palmitoylation and affect proper intracellular sorting. We confirm that CSPα has a strong intrinsic aggregation propensity; however, it is not modified by the mutations. A complementary disease-network analysis suggests a potential interaction with other NCLs genes/pathways. This is the first replication study of the identification of DNAJC5 as the disease-causing gene for autosomal dominant ANCL. The identification of the novel gene in ANCL will allow us to gain a better understanding of the pathological mechanism of ANCLs and constitutes a great advance toward the development of new molecular diagnostic tests and may lead to the development of potential therapies.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"22978711","pmcid":null,"title":"Recurrent mutations in DNAJC5 cause autosomal dominant Kufs disease.","authors":["Cadieux-Dion M","Andermann E","Lachance-Touchette P","Ansorge O","Meloche C","Barnabé A","Kuzniecky RI","Andermann F","Faught E","Leonberg S","Damiano JA","Berkovic SF","Rouleau GA","Cossette P"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":["Canadian Institutes of Health Research"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Clinical genetics","journalShort":"Clin.

Kufs disease, an adult-onset form of NCL may be recessively or dominantly inherited. Our study aimed to identify genetic mutations associated with autosomal dominant Kufs disease (ADKD). METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have studied the family first reported with this phenotype in the 1970s, the Parry family. The proband had progressive psychiatric manifestations, seizures and cognitive decline starting in her mid 20 s. Similarly affected relatives were observed in seven generations. Several of the affected individuals had post-mortem neuropathological brain study confirmatory for NCL disease. We conducted whole exome sequencing of three affected family members and identified a pLeu116del mutation in the gene DNAJC5, which segregated with the disease phenotype. An additional eight unrelated affected individuals with documented autosomal dominant or sporadic inheritance were studied. All had diagnostic confirmation with neuropathological studies of brain tissue. Among them we identified an additional individual with a p.Leu115Arg mutation in DNAJC5. In addition, a pAsn477Ser change in the neighboring gene PRPF6, a gene previously found to be associated with retinitis pigmentosa, segregated with the ADKD phenotype. Interestingly, two individuals of the Parry family did report visual impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed the recently reported association of DNAJC5 mutations with ADKD in two out of nine well-defined families. Sequence changes in PRPF6 have not been identified in other unrelated cases. The association of vision impairment with the expected PRPF6 dysfunction remains possible but would need further clinical studies in order to confirm the co-segregation of the visual impairment with this sequence change.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"12112194","pmcid":null,"title":"Autosomal dominant adult neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis: parkinsonism due to both striatal and nigral dysfunction.","authors":["Nijssen PC","Brusse E","Leyten AC","Martin JJ","Teepen JL","Roos RA"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society","journalShort":"Mov.

Disease onset was usually in the fifth decade, but was earlier in the youngest generation. Early symptoms consisted of myoclonus in face and arms, epilepsy, auditory symptoms, cognitive decline, or depression. Parkinsonism occurred a few years after disease onset, with stooped posture, shuffling gait, bradykinesia, and mask face. Four subjects deteriorated to a state of severe handicap, with severe dementia, contractures, dysphagia, and dysarthria. Leg weakness evolved to flaccid paraparesis in two patients. Diagnosis was confirmed by brain biopsy in one patient and full autopsy in two patients. Abundant intraneuronal storage of autofluorescent material was found throughout the brain. Electron microscopy showed granular osmiophilic deposits and scarce fingerprint profiles. Striking loss of neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and reticulata was found. (123)I-IBZM Single photon emission computed tomography in two patients showed loss of postsynaptic D2 receptor binding in the striatum. We conclude that parkinsonism in ANCL is likely to be caused by both presynaptic nigral cell loss and postsynaptic striatal degeneration.","affiliation":[]}],"heritability":[{"disease":{"id":"OMIM:162350","label":"Ceroid Lipofuscinosis, Neuronal, 4b, Autosomal Dominant"},"inheritance":{"id":"HP:0000006","label":"Autosomal dominant inheritance"}}],"@context":{"@base":"http://monarch-initiative.org/","id":"@id","type":{"@id":"rdf:type","@type":"@id"},"obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","DOID":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DOID_","ORPHANET":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ORPHANET_","OMIM":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OMIM_","MESH":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MESH_","PMID":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/","HP":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HP_","MP":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MP_","ZP":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ZP_","GENO":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GENO_","ECO":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ECO_","RO":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_","SO":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/SO_","BFO":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_","monarch":"http://monarch-initiative.org/","MGI":"http://monarch-initiative.org/data/MGI_","NCBIGene":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCBIGene_","MedGen":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MedGen_","SIO":"http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_","faldo":"http://biohackathon.org/resource/faldo#","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","foaf":"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/","rdf":"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","xsd":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#","owl":"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#","oboInOwl":"http://www.geneontology.org/formats/oboInOwl#","label":"rdfs:label","comment":"rdfs:comment","description":"dc:description","email":"foaf:mbox","depiction":{"@id":"foaf:depiction","@type":"@id"},"title":"dc:title","source":"dc:source","website":{"@id":"foaf:homepage","@type":"@id"},"subClassOf":"owl:subClassOf","Class":"owl:Class","has_part":"BFO:0000051","created":{"@id":"dc:created","@type":"xsd:dateTime"},"creator":{"@id":"dc:creator","@type":"@id"},"Association":"SIO:000897","phenotype_associations":"rdfs:seeAlso","genotype_associations":"rdfs:seeAlso","pathway_associations":"rdfs:seeAlso","has_genotype":"GENO:0000222","has_background":"GENO:0000010","environment":"GENO:0000099","genotype":"GENO:0000000","intrinsic_genotype":"GENO:0000000","extrinsic_genotype":"GENO:0000524","effective_genotype":"GENO:0000525","genomic_variation_complement":"GENO:0000009","genomic_background":"GENO:0000010","sequence_alteration_collection":"GENO:0000025","variant_loci":"GENO:0000027","variant_locus":"GENO:0000481","reference_locus":"GENO:0000036","gene_locus":"GENO:0000014","sequence_alteration":"SO:0001059","zygosity":"GENO:0000133","chromosome":"GENO:0000323","chromosomal_region":"GENO:0000390","morpholino":"GENO:0000417","has_phenotype":"RO:0002200","resource":"monarch:nif-resource","reference":"dc:publication","evidence":"monarch:evidence","onset":"monarch:age_of_onset","frequency":"monarch:frequency","inheritance":"monarch:mode_of_inheritance","disease":"monarch:disease","phenotype":"monarch:phenotype"}}
