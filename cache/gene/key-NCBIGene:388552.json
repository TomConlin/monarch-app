Dysbindin is a ubiquitously expressed protein that binds to alpha- and beta-dystrobrevins, components of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DPC) in both muscle and nonmuscle cells. We also show that dysbindin is a component of the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 (BLOC-1; refs. 9-11), which regulates trafficking to lysosome-related organelles and includes the proteins pallidin, muted and cappuccino, which are associated with HPS in mice.

Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome can be caused by mutations of at least four genes in humans and 15 genes in mice. One of these genes is mutated in the pallid mouse strain and encodes a novel protein named pallidin (L. Huang, Y. M. Kuo and J. Gitschier, Nat Genet 1999; 23: 329-332). Pallidin has no homology to any other known protein and no recognizable functional motifs. We have conducted a biochemical characterization of human pallidin using a newly developed polyclonal antibody. We show that pallidin is a ubiquitously expressed approximately 25 kDa protein found both in the cytosol and peripherally associated to membranes. Sedimentation velocity analyses show that native pallidin has a sedimentation coefficient of approximately 5.1 S, much larger than expected from the molecular mass of the pallidin polypeptide. In line with this observation, cosedimentation and coprecipitation analyses reveal that pallidin is part of a hetero-oligomeric complex. One of the subunits of this complex is the product of another Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome gene, muted. Fibroblasts derived from the muted mouse strain exhibit reduced levels of pallidin, suggesting that the absence of the muted protein destabilizes pallidin. These observations indicate that pallidin is a subunit of a novel multi-protein complex involved in the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"17182842","pmcid":null,"title":"BLOC-1 is required for cargo-specific sorting from vacuolar early endosomes toward lysosome-related organelles.","authors":["Setty SR","Tenza D","Truschel ST","Chou E","Sviderskaya EV","Theos AC","Lamoreux ML","Di Pietro SM","Starcevic M","Bennett DC","Dell'Angelica EC","Raposo G","Marks MS"],"grantIds":["064583","R01 EY015625","R01 EY015625","R01 EY015625-03","R01 HL068117","T32-CA009140"],"grantAgencies":["Wellcome Trust","NEI NIH HHS","NEI NIH HHS","NEI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Molecular biology of the cell","journalShort":"Mol.

HPS in humans or mice is caused by mutations in any of 15 genes, five of which encode subunits of biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex (BLOC)-1, a protein complex with no known function. Here, we show that BLOC-1 functions in selective cargo exit from early endosomes toward melanosomes. BLOC-1-deficient melanocytes accumulate the melanosomal protein tyrosinase-related protein-1 (Tyrp1), but not other melanosomal proteins, in endosomal vacuoles and the cell surface due to failed biosynthetic transit from early endosomes to melanosomes and consequent increased endocytic flux. The defects are corrected by restoration of the missing BLOC-1 subunit. Melanocytes from HPS model mice lacking a different protein complex, BLOC-2, accumulate Tyrp1 in distinct downstream endosomal intermediates, suggesting that BLOC-1 and BLOC-2 act sequentially in the same pathway. By contrast, intracellular Tyrp1 is correctly targeted to melanosomes in melanocytes lacking another HPS-associated protein complex, adaptor protein (AP)-3. The results indicate that melanosome maturation requires at least two cargo transport pathways directly from early endosomes to melanosomes, one pathway mediated by AP-3 and one pathway mediated by BLOC-1 and BLOC-2, that are deficient in several forms of HPS.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"19197348","pmcid":"2628735","title":"Genome-wide association studies in an isolated founder population from the Pacific Island of Kosrae.","authors":["Lowe JK","Maller JB","Pe'er I","Neale BM","Salit J","Kenny EE","Shea JL","Burkhardt R","Smith JG","Ji W","Noel M","Foo JN","Blundell ML","Skilling V","Garcia L","Sullivan ML","Lee HE","Labek A","Ferdowsian H","Auerbach SB","Lifton RP","Newton-Cheh C","Breslow JL","Stoffel M","Daly MJ","Altshuler DM","Friedman JM"],"grantIds":["1F32DK070527","5 U54 CA121852","5R01 DK60089"],"grantAgencies":["NIDDK NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","Howard Hughes Medical Institute"],"retractions":[],"journal":"PLoS genetics","journalShort":"PLoS Genet.","day":6,"month":2,"year":2009,"meshHeadings":["Alleles","Founder Effect","Gene Frequency","Genetic Variation","Genome, Human","Genome-Wide Association Study","Genotype","Humans","Pacific Islands","Pedigree","Selection, Genetic","Thyrotropin"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"It has been argued that the limited genetic diversity and reduced allelic heterogeneity observed in isolated founder populations facilitates discovery of loci contributing to both Mendelian and complex disease. A strong founder effect, severe isolation, and substantial inbreeding have dramatically reduced genetic diversity in natives from the island of Kosrae, Federated States of Micronesia, who exhibit a high prevalence of obesity and other metabolic disorders. We hypothesized that genetic drift and possibly natural selection on Kosrae might have increased the frequency of previously rare genetic variants with relatively large effects, making these alleles readily detectable in genome-wide association analysis. However, mapping in large, inbred cohorts introduces analytic challenges, as extensive relatedness between subjects violates the assumptions of independence upon which traditional association test statistics are based. We performed genome-wide association analysis for 15 quantitative traits in 2,906 members of the Kosrae population, using novel approaches to manage the extreme relatedness in the sample. As positive controls, we observe association to known loci for plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, and C-reactive protein and to a compelling candidate loci for thyroid stimulating hormone and fasting plasma glucose. We show that our study is well powered to detect common alleles explaining >/=5% phenotypic variance. However, no such large effects were observed with genome-wide significance, arguing that even in such a severely inbred population, common alleles typically have modest effects. Finally, we show that a majority of common variants discovered in Caucasians have indistinguishable effect sizes on Kosrae, despite the major differences in population genetics and environment.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"12576321","pmcid":null,"title":"Cappuccino, a mouse model of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, encodes a novel protein that is part of the pallidin-muted complex (BLOC-1).","authors":["Ciciotte SL","Gwynn B","Moriyama K","Huizing M","Gahl WA","Bonifacino JS","Peters LL"],"grantIds":["CA34196","HL55321","R01 HL055321","RR01183"],"grantAgencies":["NCI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NCRR NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Blood","journalShort":"Blood","day":1,"month":6,"year":2003,"meshHeadings":["Amino Acid Sequence","Animals","Carrier Proteins","DNA Mutational Analysis","Fibroblasts","Hermanski-Pudlak Syndrome","Humans","Lectins","Mice","Molecular Sequence Data","Mutation","Protein Binding","Tissue Distribution","Vesicular Transport Proteins"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is a disorder of organelle biogenesis affecting 3 related organelles-melanosomes, platelet dense bodies, and lysosomes. Four genes causing HPS in humans (HPS1-HPS4) are known, and at least 15 nonallelic mutations cause HPS in the mouse. Where their functions are known, the HPS-associated proteins are involved in some aspect of intracellular vesicular trafficking, that is, protein sorting and vesicle docking and fusion. Biochemical and genetic evidence indicates that the HPS-associated genes encode components of at least 3 distinct protein complexes: the adaptor complex AP-3; the HPS1/HPS4 complex; and BLOC-1 (biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1), consisting of the proteins encoded at 2 mouse HPS loci, pallid (pa) and muted (mu), and at least 3 other unidentified proteins. Here, we report the cloning of the mouse HPS mutation cappuccino (cno). We show that the wild-type cno gene encodes a novel, ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic protein that coassembles with pallidin and the muted protein in the BLOC-1 complex. Further, we identify a frameshift mutation in mutant cno/cno mice. The C-terminal 81 amino acids are replaced with 72 different amino acids in the mutant CNO protein, and its ability to interact in BLOC-1 is abolished. We performed mutation screening of patients with HPS and failed to identify any CNO defects. Notably, although defects in components of the HPS1/HPS4 and the AP-3 complexes are associated with HPS in humans, no defects in the known components of BLOC-1 have been identified in 142 patients with HPS screened to date, suggesting that BLOC-1 function may be critical in humans.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"12477932","pmcid":null,"title":"Generation and initial analysis of more than 15,000 full-length human and mouse cDNA sequences.","authors":["Strausberg RL","Feingold EA","Grouse LH","Derge JG","Klausner RD","Collins FS","Wagner L","Shenmen CM","Schuler GD","Altschul SF","Zeeberg B","Buetow KH","Schaefer CF","Bhat NK","Hopkins RF","Jordan H","Moore T","Max SI","Wang J","Hsieh F","Diatchenko L","Marusina K","Farmer AA","Rubin GM","Hong L","Stapleton M","Soares MB","Bonaldo MF","Casavant TL","Scheetz TE","Brownstein MJ","Usdin TB","Toshiyuki S","Carninci P","Prange C","Raha SS","Loquellano NA","Peters GJ","Abramson RD","Mullahy SJ","Bosak SA","McEwan PJ","McKernan KJ","Malek JA","Gunaratne PH","Richards S","Worley KC","Hale S","Garcia AM","Gay LJ","Hulyk SW","Villalon DK","Muzny DM","Sodergren EJ","Lu X","Gibbs RA","Fahey J","Helton E","Ketteman M","Madan A","Rodrigues S","Sanchez A","Whiting M","Madan A","Young AC","Shevchenko Y","Bouffard GG","Blakesley RW","Touchman JW","Green ED","Dickson MC","Rodriguez AC","Grimwood J","Schmutz J","Myers RM","Butterfield YS","Krzywinski MI","Skalska U","Smailus DE","Schnerch A","Schein JE","Jones SJ","Marra MA","Mammalian Gene Collection Program Team"],"grantIds":["U54 HG003273"],"grantAgencies":["NHGRI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","journalShort":"Proc.

The genes encoding these proteins are defective in inbred mouse strains that serve as models of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS), a genetic disorder characterized by hypopigmentation and platelet storage pool deficiency. In addition, mutation of human Dysbindin causes HPS type 7. Here, we report the identification of another four subunits of the complex. One is Snapin, a coiled-coil-forming protein previously characterized as a binding partner of synaptosomal-associated proteins 25 and 23 and implicated in the regulation of membrane fusion events. The other three are previously uncharacterized proteins, which we named BLOC subunits 1, 2, and 3 (BLOS1, -2, and -3). Using specific antibodies to detect endogenous proteins from human and mouse cells, we found that Snapin, BLOS1, BLOS2, and BLOS3 co-immunoprecipitate, and co-fractionate upon size exclusion chromatography, with previously known BLOC-1 subunits. Furthermore, steady-state levels of the four proteins are significantly reduced in cells from pallid mice, which carry a mutation in Pallidin and display secondary loss of other BLOC-1 subunits. Yeast two-hybrid analyses suggest a network of binary interactions involving all of the previously known and newly identified subunits. Interestingly, the HPS mouse model strain, reduced pigmentation, carries a nonsense mutation in the gene encoding BLOS3. As judged from size exclusion chromatographic analyses, the reduced pigmentation mutation affects BLOC-1 assembly less severely than the pallid mutation. Mutations in the human genes encoding Snapin and the BLOS proteins could underlie novel forms of HPS.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"11031247","pmcid":null,"title":"Secretory protein trafficking and organelle dynamics in living cells.","authors":["Lippincott-Schwartz J","Roberts TH","Hirschberg K"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Annual review of cell and developmental biology","journalShort":"Annu.

OBJECTIVES: To identify and strengthen additional loci associated with AD and confirm these in an independent sample and to examine the contribution of recently identified genes to AD risk prediction in a 3-stage analysis of new and previously published GWAS on more than 35,000 persons (8371 AD cases). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In stage 1, we identified strong genetic associations (P < 10(-3)) in a sample of 3006 AD cases and 14,642 controls by combining new data from the population-based Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology consortium (1367 AD cases [973 incident]) with previously reported results from the Translational Genomics Research Institute and the Mayo AD GWAS. We identified 2708 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with P < 10(-3). In stage 2, we pooled results for these SNPs with the European AD Initiative (2032 cases and 5328 controls) to identify 38 SNPs (10 loci) with P < 10(-5). In stage 3, we combined data for these 10 loci with data from the Genetic and Environmental Risk in AD consortium (3333 cases and 6995 controls) to identify 4 SNPs with P < 1.7x10(-8). These 4 SNPs were replicated in an independent Spanish sample (1140 AD cases and 1209 controls). Genome-wide association analyses were completed in 2007-2008 and the meta-analyses and replication in 2009. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Presence of Alzheimer disease. RESULTS: Two loci were identified to have genome-wide significance for the first time: rs744373 near BIN1 (odds ratio [OR],1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI],1.06-1.21 per copy of the minor allele; P = 1.59x10(-11)) and rs597668 near EXOC3L2/BLOC1S3/MARK4 (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.07-1.29; P = 6.45x10(-9)). Associations of these 2 loci plus the previously identified loci CLU and PICALM with AD were confirmed in the Spanish sample (P < .05). However, although CLU and PICALM were confirmed to be associated with AD in this independent sample, they did not improve the ability of a model that included age, sex, and APOE to predict incident AD (improvement in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from 0.847 to 0.849 in the Rotterdam Study and 0.702 to 0.705 in the Cardiovascular Health Study). CONCLUSIONS: Two genetic loci for AD were found for the first time to reach genome-wide statistical significance. These findings were replicated in an independent population. Two recently reported associations were also confirmed. These loci did not improve AD risk prediction. While not clinically useful, they may implicate biological pathways useful for future research.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"17081983","pmcid":null,"title":"Global, in vivo, and site-specific phosphorylation dynamics in signaling networks.","authors":["Olsen JV","Blagoev B","Gnad F","Macek B","Kumar C","Mortensen P","Mann M"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Cell","journalShort":"Cell","day":3,"month":11,"year":2006,"meshHeadings":["Binding Sites","Databases, Factual","Epidermal Growth Factor","HeLa Cells","Humans","Kinetics","Mass Spectrometry","Neoplasm Proteins","Peptides","Phosphorylation","Phosphotyrosine","Protein Binding","Protein Processing, Post-Translational","Proteome","Signal Transduction"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Cell signaling mechanisms often transmit information via posttranslational protein modifications, most importantly reversible protein phosphorylation. Here we develop and apply a general mass spectrometric technology for identification and quantitation of phosphorylation sites as a function of stimulus, time, and subcellular location. We have detected 6,600 phosphorylation sites on 2,244 proteins and have determined their temporal dynamics after stimulating HeLa cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and recorded them in the Phosida database. Fourteen percent of phosphorylation sites are modulated at least 2-fold by EGF, and these were classified by their temporal profiles. Surprisingly, a majority of proteins contain multiple phosphorylation sites showing different kinetics, suggesting that they serve as platforms for integrating signals. In addition to protein kinase cascades, the targets of reversible phosphorylation include ubiquitin ligases, guanine nucleotide exchange factors, and at least 46 different transcriptional regulators. The dynamic phosphoproteome provides a missing link in a global, integrative view of cellular regulation.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"16385460","pmcid":null,"title":"A germline mutation in BLOC1S3/reduced pigmentation causes a novel variant of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS8).","authors":["Morgan NV","Pasha S","Johnson CA","Ainsworth JR","Eady RA","Dawood B","McKeown C","Trembath RC","Wilde J","Watson SP","Maher ER"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":["Wellcome Trust"],"retractions":[],"journal":"American journal of human genetics","journalShort":"Am.

Autozygosity mapping studies were undertaken in a large consanguineous family with HPS. Affected individuals displayed features of incomplete oculocutaneous albinism and platelet dysfunction. Skin biopsy demonstrated abnormal aggregates of melanosomes within basal epidermal keratinocytes. A homozygous germline frameshift mutation in BLOC1S3 (p.Gln150ArgfsX75) was identified in all affected individuals. BLOC1S3 mutations have not been previously described in patients with HPS, but BLOC1S3 encodes a subunit of the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 (BLOC-1). Mutations in other BLOC-1 subunits have been associated with an HPS phenotype in humans and/or mouse, and a nonsense mutation in the murine orthologue of BLOC1S3 causes the reduced pigmentation (rp) model of HPS. Interestingly, eye pigment formation is reported to be normal in rp, but we found visual defects (nystagmus, iris transilluminancy, foveal hypoplasia, reduced visual acuity, and evidence of optic pathway misrouting) in affected individuals. These findings define a novel form of human HPS (HPS8) and extend genotype-phenotype correlations in HPS.","affiliation":[]}]}
