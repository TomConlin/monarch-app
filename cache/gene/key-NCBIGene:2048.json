These receptors are composed of an N-terminal glycosylated ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane region and an intracellular kinase domain. They bind ligands called ephrins and are involved in diverse cellular processes including motility, division, and differentiation. A distinguishing characteristic of Eph-ephrin signaling is that both receptors and ligands are competent to transduce a signaling cascade, resulting in bidirectional signaling. This protein belongs to a subgroup of the Eph receptors called EphB. Proteins of this subgroup are distinguished from other members of the family by sequence homology and preferential binding affinity for membrane-bound ephrin-B ligands. Allelic variants are associated with prostate and brain cancer susceptibility. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.","taxon":{"id":"NCBITaxon:9606","label":"Homo

EphA2 is one prominent member that is overexpressed and functionally altered in many invasive cancers, including pancreatic cancer. Dasatinib, which is a multi-targeted kinase inhibitor mainly developed for Bcr-Abl and Src family kinases, has recently been shown to have significant activity against EphA2. As selective small molecule EphA2 inhibitors are not currently available, we investigated the therapeutic potential to target EphA2 by dasatinib in pancreatic cancer cell lines. Using in vitro kinase assays, we found that EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase was inhibited directly by dasatinib in a dose-dependent manner. Stimulation with ephrinA1 produced rapid increases of EphA2 phosphorylation that were inhibited by dasatinib, although the effects on activation of downstream signalling differed among the pancreatic cancer cell lines. Dasatinib also inhibited ligand-induced binding of EphA2 to the ubiquitin ligase Cbl, and the internalisation and degradation of EphA2, suggesting that these processes are dependent on kinase activity. Treatment with dasatinib decreased EphA2 phosphorylation in BxPC-3 xenografts, suggesting that dasatinib might have activity in pancreatic cancer due to EphA2 inhibition, besides its effects on Src.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"11641781","pmcid":null,"title":"MST4, a new Ste20-related kinase that mediates cell growth and transformation via modulating ERK pathway.","authors":["Lin JL","Chen HC","Fang HI","Robinson D","Kung HJ","Shih HM"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Oncogene","journalShort":"Oncogene","day":4,"month":10,"year":2001,"meshHeadings":["Amino Acid Sequence","Cell Division","Cell Transformation, Neoplastic","Cloning, Molecular","Humans","MAP Kinase Kinase 1","MAP Kinase Signaling System","Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases","Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases","Models, Biological","Molecular Sequence Data","Neoplasms","Phylogeny","Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases","RNA, Messenger","Sequence Homology, Amino Acid","Tissue Distribution","Tumor Cells, Cultured"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"In this study, we report the cloning and characterization of a novel human Ste20-related kinase that we designated MST4. The 416 amino acid full-length MST4 contains an amino-terminal kinase domain, which is highly homologous to MST3 and SOK, and a unique carboxy-terminal domain. Northern blot analysis indicated that MST4 is highly expressed in placenta, thymus, and peripheral blood leukocytes. Wild-type but not kinase-dead MST4 can phosphorylate myelin basic protein in an in vitro kinase assay. MST4 specifically activates ERK but not JNK or p38 MAPK in transient transfected cells or in stable cell lines. Overexpression of dominant negative MEK1 or treatment with PD98059 abolishes MST4-induced ERK activity, whereas dominant-negative Ras or c-Raf-1 mutants failed to do so, indicating MST4 activates MEK1/ERK via a Ras/Raf-1 independent pathway. HeLa and Phoenix cell lines overexpressing wild-type, but not kinase-dead, MST4 exhibit increased growth rate and form aggressive soft-agar colonies. These phenotypes can be inhibited by PD98059. These results provide the first evidence that MST4 is biologically active in the activation of MEK/ERK pathway and in mediating cell growth and transformation.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"11780069","pmcid":null,"title":"Crystal structure of an Eph receptor-ephrin complex.","authors":["Himanen JP","Rajashankar KR","Lackmann M","Cowan CA","Henkemeyer M","Nikolov DB"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Nature","journalShort":"Nature","day":7,"month":1,"year":2002,"meshHeadings":["Amino Acid Sequence","Animals","Crystallography, X-Ray","Dimerization","Ephrin-B2","Escherichia coli","Ligands","Macromolecular Substances","Membrane Proteins","Mice","Models, Molecular","Molecular Sequence Data","Protein Binding","Protein Conformation","Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases","Receptor, EphB2","Recombinant Proteins","Sequence Alignment"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"The Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and their membrane-anchored ephrin ligands are important in regulating cell-cell interactions as they initiate a unique bidirectional signal transduction cascade whereby information is communicated into both the Eph-expressing and the ephrin-expressing cells. Initially identified as regulators of axon pathfinding and neuronal cell migration, Ephs and ephrins are now known to have roles in many other cell-cell interactions, including those of vascular endothelial cells and specialized epithelia. Here we report the crystal structure of the complex formed between EphB2 and ephrin-B2, determined at 2.7 A resolution. Each Eph receptor binds an ephrin ligand through an expansive dimerization interface dominated by the insertion of an extended ephrin loop into a channel at the surface of the receptor. Two Eph-Ephrin dimers then join to form a tetramer, in which each ligand interacts with two receptors and each receptor interacts with two ligands. The Eph and ephrin molecules are precisely positioned and orientated in these complexes, promoting higher-order clustering and the initiation of bidirectional signalling.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"15225643","pmcid":null,"title":"The phosphorylation status and anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-2 are regulated by ERK and protein phosphatase 2A on the mitochondria.","authors":["Tamura Y","Simizu S","Osada H"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"FEBS letters","journalShort":"FEBS Lett.","day":2,"month":7,"year":2004,"meshHeadings":["Apoptosis","Carcinoma, Hepatocellular","Cell Line, Tumor","Enzyme Inhibitors","HeLa Cells","Humans","Kinetics","Liver Neoplasms","Mitochondria","Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1","Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases","Mutagenesis","Phosphoprotein Phosphatases","Phosphorylation","Plasmids","Protein Phosphatase 2","Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2","Recombinant Proteins","Sequence Deletion"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Bcl-2 protein play important roles in the regulation of apoptosis. We previously reported that the phosphorylation of Bcl-2 was augmented by treatment with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor; however, the kinase responsible for Bcl-2 phosphorylation had not yet been identified. In this study, we identified extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) as the responsible kinase for the phosphorylation of Bcl-2. We also found that the transmembrane region (TM) deleted form of Bcl-2 (Bcl-2DeltaTM), which was unable to localize on the mitochondria was constitutively phosphorylated, whereas wild-type Bcl-2 that localized on the mitochondria, was present in its hypophosphorylated form. The phosphorylation of Bcl-2DeltaTM was retarded by treatment with MAP kinase ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor and PP2A did not bind to Bcl-2DeltaTM. These observations suggest that Bcl-2DeltaTM is constitutively phosphorylated by ERK, but is not dephosphorylated by PP2A in human tumor cell lines. The phosphorylation of Bcl-2 resulted in a reduction in anti-apoptotic function, implying that dephosphorylation promoted the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-2 protein in human tumor cell lines. Thus, the present findings suggest that ERK and PP2A are physiological regulators of Bcl-2 phosphorylation, and these enzymes exert an influence on the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-2.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"9632142","pmcid":null,"title":"Complex formation between EphB2 and Src requires phosphorylation of tyrosine 611 in the EphB2 juxtamembrane region.","authors":["Zisch AH","Kalo MS","Chong LD","Pasquale EB"],"grantIds":["EY105576","HD25938"],"grantAgencies":["NEI NIH HHS","NICHD NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Oncogene","journalShort":"Oncogene","day":29,"month":5,"year":1998,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Binding Sites","Chickens","Escherichia coli","Mutagenesis, Site-Directed","Neurons","Peptide Mapping","Phosphorylation","Proteins","Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases","Receptor, EphB2","Recombinant Fusion Proteins","Retina","Tyrosine","src Homology Domains"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"The cellular components of the neuronal signaling pathways of Eph receptor tyrosine kinases are only beginning to be elucidated. Here we show that in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation sites of the Eph receptors EphA3, EphA4, and EphB2 in embryonic retina serve as binding sites for the Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain of Src kinase. Furthermore, tyrosine-phosphorylated EphB2 was detected in Src immunoprecipitates from transfected Cos cells, indicating that EphB2 and Src can physically associate. Interestingly, a form of Src with reduced electrophoretic mobility and increased tyrosine phosphorylation was detected in Cos cells expressing tyrosine-phosphorylated EphB2, suggesting a functional interaction between EphB2 and Src. Yeast two-hybrid analysis in conjunction with site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that phosphorylated tyrosine 611 in the juxtamembrane region of EphB2 is crucial for the interaction with the SH2 domain of Src. In contrast, binding of the carboxy-terminal SH2 domain of phospholipase Cgamma was not abolished upon mutation of tyrosine 611 in EphB2.

A second, phosphorylation-independent interaction with EphB2 involves non-conserved sequences in the C-terminal tails of Abl and Arg. A third interaction between Abl and EphB2 is probably mediated by an intermediary protein because it requires tyrosine phosphorylation of EphB2, but not the binding sites for the Abl SH2 domain. The connection between EphB2 and Abl/Arg appears to be reciprocal. Activated EphB2 causes tyrosine phosphorylation of Abl and Arg, and vice versa. Interestingly, treatment of COS cells and B35 neuronal-like cells with ephrin-B1 to activate endogenous EphB2 decreased the kinase activity of endogenous Abl.

Decreased adhesion is thought to promote tumor cell invasion. R-Ras, a small intracellular GTPase, regulates the binding of integrins to their ligands outside the cell. Here we show that the Eph receptor tyrosine kinase, EphB2, can control integrin activity through R-Ras. Cells in which EphB2 is activated become poorly adherent to substrates coated with integrin ligands, and a tyrosine residue in the R-Ras effector domain is phosphorylated. The R-Ras phosphorylation and loss of cell adhesion are causally related, because forced expression of an R-Ras variant resistant to phosphorylation at the critical site made cells unresponsive to the anti-adhesive effect of EphB2. This is an unusual regulatory pathway among the small GTPases. Reduced adhesiveness induced through the Eph/R-Ras pathway may explain the repulsive effect of the Eph receptors in axonal pathfinding and may facilitate tumor cell invasion and angiogenesis.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"8878483","pmcid":null,"title":"Bidirectional signalling through the EPH-family receptor Nuk and its transmembrane ligands.","authors":["Holland SJ","Gale NW","Mbamalu G","Yancopoulos GD","Henkemeyer M","Pawson T"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Nature","journalShort":"Nature","day":24,"month":10,"year":1996,"meshHeadings":["Amino Acid Sequence","Animals","COS Cells","Cell Membrane","Coculture Techniques","DNA-Binding Proteins","Ephrin-B2","Ligands","Membrane Proteins","Mice","Molecular Sequence Data","Phosphorylation","Proto-Oncogene Proteins","Rats","Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases","Receptor, EphB2","Recombinant Fusion Proteins","Signal Transduction","Transcription Factors","Tumor Cells, Cultured","Tyrosine","ets-Domain Protein Elk-1"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Receptor tyrosine kinases of the EPH class have been implicated in the control of axon guidance and fasciculation, in regulating cell migration, and in defining compartments in the developing embryo. Efficient activation of EPH receptors generally requires that their ligands be anchored to the cell surface, either through a transmembrane (TM) region or a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) group. These observations have suggested that EPH receptors can transduce signals initiated by direct cell-cell interaction. Genetic analysis of Nuk, a murine EPH receptor that binds TM ligands, has raised the possibility that these ligands might themselves have a signalling function. Consistent with this, the three known TM ligands have a highly conserved cytoplasmic region, with multiple potential sites for tyrosine phosphorylation. Here we show that challenging cells that express the TM ligands Elk-L or Htk-L with the clustered ectodomain of Nuk induces phosphorylation of the ligands on tyrosine, a process that can be mimicked both in vitro and in vivo by an activated Src tyrosine kinase. Co-culture of cells expressing a TM ligand with cells expressing Nuk leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of both the ligand and Nuk. These results suggest that the TM ligands are associated with a tyrosine kinase, and are inducibly phosphorylated upon binding Nuk, in a fashion reminiscent of cytokine receptors. Furthermore, we show that TM ligands, as well as Nuk, are phosphorylated on tyrosine in mouse embryos, indicating that this is a physiological process. EPH receptors and their TM ligands therefore mediate bidirectional cell signalling.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"10053012","pmcid":null,"title":"Evidence for a rare prostate cancer-susceptibility locus at chromosome 1p36.","authors":["Gibbs M","Stanford JL","McIndoe RA","Jarvik GP","Kolb S","Goode EL","Chakrabarti L","Schuster EF","Buckley VA","Miller EL","Brandzel S","Li S","Hood L","Ostrander EA"],"grantIds":["R01 CA56678"],"grantAgencies":["NCI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"American journal of human genetics","journalShort":"Am.

The DRT gene is expressed in three different size transcripts (i.e. 4, 5 and 11 kb). DRT transcripts are expressed in human brain and several other tissues, including heart, lung, kidney, placenta, pancreas, liver and skeletal muscle, but the 11 kb DRT transcript is preferentially expressed in fetal brain. Steady-state levels of DRT mRNA in several tissues, including brain, heart, lung and kidney, are greater in the midterm fetus than those in the adult. DRT transcripts are detectable at low levels in a human teratocarcinoma cell line (NTera-2), but its expression is greatly increased after the NTera-2 cells are induced to become postmitotic neurons (NTera-2N) by retinoic acid treatment. These data suggest that DRT plays a part in human neurogenesis. A large number of tumor cell lines derived from neuroectoderm express DRT transcripts, including 12 neuroblastomas, two medulloblastomas, one primitive neuroectodermal tumor and six small cell lung carcinomas (SCLC). Interestingly, several neuroblastoma cell lines with 1p deletion and one SCLC cell line express DRT transcripts of aberrant size (i.e. 3, 6 and 8 kb) in addition to those found in normal tissues. We mapped the DRT gene to human chromosome 1p35-1p36.1 by PCR screening of human-rodent somatic cell hybrid panels and by fluorescence in situ hybridization. As the distal end of chromosome 1p is often deleted in neuroblastomas and altered in some cases in SCLCs, these chromosomal abnormalities may have resulted in the generation of aberrant size transcripts. Thus, the DRT gene may play a part in neuroblastoma and SCLC tumorigenesis.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"9933164","pmcid":null,"title":"Oligomeric structure of the human EphB2 receptor SAM domain.","authors":["Thanos CD","Goodwill KE","Bowie JU"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","journalShort":"Science","day":5,"month":2,"year":1999,"meshHeadings":["Binding Sites","Crystallization","Crystallography, X-Ray","Dimerization","GRB10 Adaptor Protein","Humans","Hydrogen Bonding","Kinesin","Models, Molecular","Myosins","Phosphorylation","Protein Conformation","Protein Structure, Secondary","Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases","Proteins","Receptor Aggregation","Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases","Receptor, EphB2","Recombinant Proteins","Surface Properties"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"The sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain is a protein interaction module that is present in diverse signal-transducing proteins.

In addition, the N-terminal kinase must be phosphorylated at Ser(227) in the activation loop by an as yet unidentified kinase. Here, we show that the isolated N-terminal kinase of RSK2 (amino acids 1-360) is phosphorylated at Ser(227) by PDK1, a constitutively active kinase, leading to 100-fold stimulation of kinase activity.

Similarly, two other members of the RSK family, RSK1 and RSK3, were partially activated by PDK1 in COS7 cells.

These two new members of the eph subclass of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, eek and erk, may therefore have tissue-specific functions distinct from those of other eph family members.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"8033077","pmcid":null,"title":"Overexpression of ERK, an EPH family receptor protein tyrosine kinase, in various human tumors.","authors":["Kiyokawa E","Takai S","Tanaka M","Iwase T","Suzuki M","Xiang YY","Naito Y","Yamada K","Sugimura H","Kino I"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Cancer research","journalShort":"Cancer Res.","day":15,"month":7,"year":1994,"meshHeadings":["Amino Acid Sequence","Base Sequence","DNA, Complementary","Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic","Humans","In Situ Hybridization","Molecular Sequence Data","Neoplasms","RNA, Messenger","Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases","Receptor, EphB2"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"The ERK gene has been isolated as a genomic DNA encoding a part of the receptor protein-tyrosine kinase which belongs to the EPH subfamily.

Interactions between these molecules are promiscuous, but they largely fall into two groups: EphA receptors bind to GPI-anchored ephrin-A ligands, while EphB receptors bind to ephrin-B proteins that have a transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain. Remarkably, ephrin-B proteins transduce signals, such that bidirectional signaling can occur upon interaction with Eph receptor. In many tissues, specific Eph receptors and ephrins have complementary domains, whereas other family members may overlap in their expression. An important role of Eph receptors and ephrins is to mediate cell-contact-dependent repulsion. Complementary and overlapping gradients of expression underlie establishment of a topographic map of neuronal projections in the retinotectal system. Eph receptors and ephrins also act at boundaries to channel neuronal growth cones along specific pathways, restrict the migration of neural crest cells, and via bidirectional signaling prevent intermingling between hindbrain segments. Intriguingly, Eph receptors and ephrins can also trigger an adhesive response of endothelial cells and are required for the remodeling of blood vessels. Biochemical studies suggest that the extent of multimerization of Eph receptors modulates the cellular response and that the actin cytoskeleton is one major target of the intracellular pathways activated by Eph receptors. Eph receptors and ephrins have thus emerged as key regulators of the repulsion and adhesion of cells that underlie the establishment, maintenance, and remodeling of patterns of cellular organization.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"10523848","pmcid":null,"title":"alphaPIX nucleotide exchange factor is activated by interaction with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.","authors":["Yoshii S","Tanaka M","Otsuki Y","Wang DY","Guo RJ","Zhu Y","Takeda R","Hanai H","Kaneko E","Sugimura H"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Oncogene","journalShort":"Oncogene","day":7,"month":10,"year":1999,"meshHeadings":["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing","Animals","COS Cells","Cell Adhesion","Cell Cycle Proteins","Cell Movement","Cercopithecus aethiops","Cytoskeleton","Extracellular Matrix","Fibronectins","GTP Phosphohydrolases","Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors","MAP Kinase Signaling System","Macromolecular Substances","Mesoderm","Microinjections","Models, Biological","Oncogene Proteins","Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases","Phosphorylation","Protein Isoforms","Protein Processing, Post-Translational","Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases","Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases","Receptor, EphB2","Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor","Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors","Signal Transduction","Xenopus laevis","p21-Activated Kinases","src Homology Domains"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"p21-activated kinase (PAK) is a common effector protein of the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac, leading to the activation of downstream mitogen activated protein kinases.

In this study, we show that one of the isoforms of PIX, alphaPIX, is activated by signaling cascades from the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor and EphB2 receptor, and from integrin-induced signaling through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase). alphaPIX is activated by forming a complex with these receptors either via association with PAK and Nck, or direct association with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3-kinase. Synthetic phosphoinositide and membrane targeted PI3-kinase augmented the alphaPIX activity in vivo. In Xenopus, aggregates of mesodermal cells derived from embryos microinjected with alphaPIX significantly increased the peripheral spreading on fibronectin substrate in response to PDGF through PI3-kinase. These results indicate that alphaPIX is activated by PI3-kinase, and is involved in the receptor mediated signaling leading to the activation of the kinase activity of PAK, and the migration of mesodermal cells on extracellular matrix.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"12477932","pmcid":null,"title":"Generation and initial analysis of more than 15,000 full-length human and mouse cDNA sequences.","authors":["Strausberg RL","Feingold EA","Grouse LH","Derge JG","Klausner RD","Collins FS","Wagner L","Shenmen CM","Schuler GD","Altschul SF","Zeeberg B","Buetow KH","Schaefer CF","Bhat NK","Hopkins RF","Jordan H","Moore T","Max SI","Wang J","Hsieh F","Diatchenko L","Marusina K","Farmer AA","Rubin GM","Hong L","Stapleton M","Soares MB","Bonaldo MF","Casavant TL","Scheetz TE","Brownstein MJ","Usdin TB","Toshiyuki S","Carninci P","Prange C","Raha SS","Loquellano NA","Peters GJ","Abramson RD","Mullahy SJ","Bosak SA","McEwan PJ","McKernan KJ","Malek JA","Gunaratne PH","Richards S","Worley KC","Hale S","Garcia AM","Gay LJ","Hulyk SW","Villalon DK","Muzny DM","Sodergren EJ","Lu X","Gibbs RA","Fahey J","Helton E","Ketteman M","Madan A","Rodrigues S","Sanchez A","Whiting M","Madan A","Young AC","Shevchenko Y","Bouffard GG","Blakesley RW","Touchman JW","Green ED","Dickson MC","Rodriguez AC","Grimwood J","Schmutz J","Myers RM","Butterfield YS","Krzywinski MI","Skalska U","Smailus DE","Schnerch A","Schein JE","Jones SJ","Marra MA","Mammalian Gene Collection Program Team"],"grantIds":["U54 HG003273"],"grantAgencies":["NHGRI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","journalShort":"Proc.

The aim of this study was to identify new proteins associated with the invasion capacity of Wilms tumor. PROCEDURE: Gene expression profiles for 15 primary Wilms tumor samples were determined by Affymetrix Genechip® Human Genome Ul33A microarray analysis. The gene expression profiles for selected genes was further confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on 25 Wilms tumor cases to confirm expression for Bcl2A1, EphB2, MSX1, and RIN1. RESULTS: Using microarray analysis 14 genes showed differential expression (P < 0.05) comparing stage 1 non-invasive Wilms tumor to stages 2-4 invasive Wilms tumor. The differential expression for Bcl2A1, EphB2, MSX1, and RIN1 was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. MSX1 protein was statistically significantly lower in stages 2-4 invasive Wilms tumor cases compared to stage 1 non-invasive cases (P = 0.013). EphB2 protein was higher in stages 2-4 Wilms tumor cases compared to stage 1 cases (P = 0.006). There was no statistically significant difference between stages 1 and 2-4 Wilms tumor for Bcl2A1 (P = 0.230) or RIN1 (P = 0.969) at the protein level.

We have investigated the cytoplasmic signaling events associated with EphB2-induced cytoskeletal reorganization in these neuronal cells. We find that unlike other receptor tyrosine kinases, EphB2 induces a pronounced downregulation of GTP-bound Ras and consequently of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. A similar inhibition of the Ras-MAPK pathway was observed on stimulation of endogenous EphB2 in COS-1 cells. Inactivation of Ras, induced by ephrin B1 stimulation of NG108 neuronal cells, requires EphB2 tyrosine kinase activity and is blocked by a truncated form of p120-Ras GTPase-activating protein (p120-RasGAP), suggesting that EphB2 signals through the SH2 domain protein p120-RasGAP to inhibit the Ras-MAPK pathway. Suppression of Ras activity appears functionally important, since expression of a constitutively active variant of Ras impaired the ability of EphB2 to induce neurite retraction. In addition, EphB2 attenuated the elevation in ERK activation induced by attachment of NG108 cells to fibronectin, indicating that the EphB2 receptor can modulate integrin signaling to the Ras GTPase. These results suggest that a primary function of EphB2, a member of the most populous family of receptor tyrosine kinases, is to inactivate the Ras-MAPK pathway in a fashion that contributes to cytoskeletal reorganization and adhesion responses in neuronal growth cones.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"10648599","pmcid":null,"title":"Extracellular signal-regulated kinase binds to TFII-I and regulates its activation of the c-fos promoter.","authors":["Kim DW","Cochran BH"],"grantIds":["R01-GM51551"],"grantAgencies":["NIGMS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Molecular and cellular biology","journalShort":"Mol.

The Mek1 inhibitor, PD98059 abrogates the enhancement of the c-fos promoter by TFII-I, indicating that TFII-I function is dependent on an active mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway. Analysis of the TFII-I protein sequence revealed that TFII-I contains a consensus MAP kinase interaction domain (D box). Consistent with this, we have found that TFII-I forms an in vivo complex with extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK). Point mutations within the consensus MAP kinase binding motif of TFII-I inhibit its ability to bind ERK and its ability to enhance the c-fos promoter. Therefore, the D box of TFII-I is required for its activity on the c-fos promoter. Moreover, the interaction between TFII-I and ERK can be regulated. Serum stimulation enhances complex formation between TFII-I and ERK, and dominant-negative Ras abrogates this interaction. In addition, TFII-I can be phosphorylated in vitro by ERK and mutation of consensus MAP kinase substrate sites at serines 627 and 633 impairs the phosphorylation of TFII-I by ERK and its activity on the c-fos promoter.

Ephrin-B proteins transduce signals, such that bidirectional signalling can occur upon interaction with the Eph receptor. In many tissues, there are complementary and overlapping expression domains of interacting Eph receptors and ephrins. An important role of Eph receptors and ephrins is to mediate cell contact-dependent repulsion, and this has been implicated in the pathfinding of axons and neural crest cells, and the restriction of cell intermingling between hindbrain segments. Studies in an in vitro system show that bidirectional activation is required to prevent intermingling between cell populations, whereas unidirectional activation can restrict cell communication via gap junctions. Recent work indicates that Eph receptors can also upregulate cell adhesion, but the biochemical basis of repulsion versus adhesion responses is unclear.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Myeloid differentiation was evaluated by morphology, function (respiratory burst activity), and cell surface expression of adhesion molecule (CD11b), and activation of ERK and/or p38 was determined by Western blotting and/or in vitro kinase assay. Inhibition of the ERK pathway was performed using PD98059, a specific inhibitor of this pathway. RESULTS: U937 cells were induced to be differentiated by the combination of GM-CSF and TNF, but only minimally by either cytokine alone. Transient phosphorylation and activation of ERK was induced by both GM-CSF alone and combination of the two cytokines, whereas sustained phosphorylation and activation was induced only by the combination. In addition, PD98059, a specific inhibitor of ERK pathway, almost completely abolished this prolonged phosphorylation of ERK and completely blocked differentiation. In contrast, both TNF alone and cytokine combination equivalently phosphorylated p38 in U937 cells, which was dissociated from differentiation, and a specific inhibitor of p38 (SB203580) did not inhibit differentiation.

These findings suggest an important role for Vav family GEFs as regulators of ligand-receptor endocytosis and determinants of repulsive signaling during axon guidance.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"12058067","pmcid":null,"title":"Extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylates tumor necrosis factor alpha-converting enzyme at threonine 735: a potential role in regulated shedding.","authors":["Díaz-Rodríguez E","Montero JC","Esparís-Ogando A","Yuste L","Pandiella A"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Molecular biology of the cell","journalShort":"Mol.

We report that the cytosolic tail of the tumor necrosis factor alpha-converting enzyme (TACE) is phosphorylated by Erk at threonine 735. In addition, we show that Erk and TACE associate. This association is favored by Erk activation and by the presence of threonine 735.

This study was designed to investigate the expression of EPHB2 and its ligands, EFNB1 and EFNB2, in human gastric cancer. METHODS: Semi-quantitative RT-PCR using (32)P was performed on human gastric cancer tissues and corresponding normal tissues (29 gastric cancer patients). RESULTS: EPHB2 was more highly expressed in tumor tissues than in normal tissues in 21 out of 29 (72.4%), in gastric cancer patients ( P = 0.01); EFNB1 and EFNB2 were highly expressed in 21 out of 29 (72.4%) ( P = 0.037) and 14 out of 29 (48.3%) patients, respectively. The overexpression of EPHB2 was frequently detected in both well-differentiated adenocarcinoma and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma [10/13 (76.9%) and 9/14 (64.3%), respectively]. On the other hand, the overexpression of EFNB1 was more frequently detected in poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma than in well-differentiated adenocarcinoma [12/14 (85.7%) and 7/13 (53.8%), respectively.

EphB2 is a tyrosine kinase recently implicated in the deregulation of cell-to-cell communication in many tumors. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: EphB2 protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays that included 76 different normal tissues, >4,000 samples from 138 different cancer types, and 1,476 samples of colon cancer with clinical follow-up data. RESULTS: We found most prominent EphB2 expression in the intestinal epithelium (colonic crypts) with cancer of the colorectum displaying the highest EphB2 positivity of all tumors. Positivity was found in 100% of 118 colon adenomas but in 33.3% of 45 colon carcinomas. EphB2 expression was also observed in 75 tumor categories, including serous carcinoma of the endometrium (34.8%), adenocarcinoma of the esophagus (33.3%), intestinal adenocarcinoma of the stomach (30.2%), and adenocarcinoma of the small intestine (70%). The occasional finding of strong EphB2 positivity in tumors without EphB2 positivity in the corresponding normal cells [adenocarcinoma of the lung (4%) and pancreas (2.2%)] suggests that deregulation of EphB2 signaling may involve up-regulation of the protein expression. In colon carcinoma, loss of EphB2 expression was associated with advanced stage (P < 0.0001) and was an indicator of poor overall survival (P = 0.0098). CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide an overview on the EphB2 protein expression in normal and neoplastic tissues.

Quantitative features, including intensity, timing, and duration of phosphorylation of particular residues, may play a role in determining cellular response, but experimental data required for analysis of these features have not previously been available. To understand the dynamic operation of signaling cascades, we have developed a method enabling the simultaneous quantification of tyrosine phosphorylation of specific residues on dozens of key proteins in a time-resolved manner, downstream of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation. Tryptic peptides from four different EGFR stimulation time points were labeled with four isoforms of the iTRAQ reagent to enable downstream quantification. After mixing of the labeled samples, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides were immunoprecipitated with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and further enriched by IMAC before LC/MS/MS analysis. Database searching and manual confirmation of peptide phosphorylation site assignments led to the identification of 78 tyrosine phosphorylation sites on 58 proteins from a single analysis. Replicate analyses of a separate biological sample provided both validation of this first data set and identification of 26 additional tyrosine phosphorylation sites and 18 additional proteins. iTRAQ fragment ion ratios provided time course phosphorylation profiles for each site. The data set of quantitative temporal phosphorylation profiles was further characterized by self-organizing maps, which resulted in identification of several cohorts of tyrosine residues exhibiting self-similar temporal phosphorylation profiles, operationally defining dynamic modules in the EGFR signaling network consistent with particular cellular processes. The presence of novel proteins and associated tyrosine phosphorylation sites within these modules indicates additional components of this network and potentially localizes the topological action of these proteins. Additional analysis and modeling of the data generated in this study are likely to yield more sophisticated models of receptor tyrosine kinase-initiated signal transduction, trafficking, and regulation.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"15722342","pmcid":null,"title":"EphB receptor-binding peptides identified by phage display enable design of an antagonist with ephrin-like affinity.","authors":["Koolpe M","Burgess R","Dail M","Pasquale EB"],"grantIds":["CA82713","HD25938"],"grantAgencies":["NCI NIH HHS","NICHD NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"The Journal of biological chemistry","journalShort":"J.

Peptides with the same EphB receptor specificity compete with each other for binding, suggesting that they have partially overlapping binding sites. In addition, several of the peptides contain amino acid motifs found in the G-H loop of the ephrin-B ligands, which is the region that mediates high-affinity interaction with the EphB receptors. Consistent with targeting the ephrin-binding site, the higher affinity peptides antagonize ephrin binding to the EphB receptors.

By using biochemical and functional approaches, we investigated how ephrinB and SDF-1 orchestrate endothelial cell movement and morphogenesis into capillary-like structures. We describe how endogenous EphB2 and EphB4 signaling are required for the formation of extracellular matrix-dependent capillary-like structures in primary human endothelial cells. We further demonstrate that EphB2 and EphB4 activation enhance SDF-1-induced signaling and chemotaxis that are also required for extracellular matrix-dependent endothelial cell clustering. These results support a model in which SDF-1 gradients first promote endothelial cell clustering and then EphB2 and EphB4 critically contribute to subsequent cell movement and alignment into cord-like structures.

METHODS: Direct sequencing of the coding region of EphB2 was performed on 72 probands from the African American Hereditary Prostate Cancer Study (AAHPC). A case-control association analysis was then carried out using the AAHPC probands and an additional 183 cases of sporadic PC compared with 329 healthy AA male controls. In addition, we performed an ancestry adjusted association study where we adjusted for individual ancestry among all subjects, in order to rule out a spurious association due to population stratification. RESULTS: Ten coding sequence variants were identified, including the K1019X (3055A-->T) nonsense mutation which was present in 15.3% of the AAHPC probands but only 1.7% of 231 European American (EA) control samples.

This approach resulted in the direct purification of cell type-specific sets of expressed protein kinases, and more than 140 different members of this enzyme family could be detected by LC-MS/MS. Furthermore the enrichment technique combined with phosphopeptide fractionation led to the identification of more than 200 different phosphorylation sites on protein kinases, which often remain occluded in global phosphoproteome analysis.

Targeted deletions of the genes reveal their essential roles for conduit vessel development in mice, suggesting similar functions during human vascular development and deregulation in vascular malformations. Here, we have defined the expression patterns of human ephrinB2, EphB4, and EphB2 in normal vessels of neonates (i.e. umbilici) and adults and compared them with those in congenital venous malformations.

In venous malformations, the expression of EphB4 is not altered, but both ephrinB2 and EphB2 are ectopically expressed in venous ECs.

Recently, it has been shown that reduction of EphB activity accelerates colon tumour progression in the Apc(Min/+) mice. In this study, we examined the expression of EphB2 in normal colon, adenomas, primary colorectal cancers (CRCs), lymph node metastases and liver metastases using immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. In addition, EphB2 was overexpressed in SW480 colon cancer cells to study its effect in vitro. We found that EphB2 was expressed in 100% of normal colon crypt base cells, 78% of adenomas, 55.4% of primary CRCs, 37.8% of lymph node metastases and 32.9% of liver metastases (all differences were statistically significant at P < 0.001 compared with primary CRCs). Patients with CRCs that lose EphB2 expression had more advanced tumour stage (P = 0.005), poor differentiation (P < 0.001), poor overall survival (P = 0.005) and disease-free survival (P = 0.001), with the latter being independent of tumour stage. In vitro studies showed that overexpression of EphB2 inhibited colon cancer cell growth in colony formation assay and activation of EphB2 receptor inhibited colon cancer cell adhesion and migration. Our data demonstrated a progressive loss of EphB2 expression in each critical step of colon carcinogenesis, including the onset of invasion, dedifferentiation and metastasis which are paralleled by adverse patient outcome. EphB2 may achieve its tumour suppressor function through regulation of cell survival, adhesion and migration.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"16710414","pmcid":null,"title":"The DNA sequence and biological annotation of human chromosome 1.","authors":["Gregory SG","Barlow KF","McLay KE","Kaul R","Swarbreck D","Dunham A","Scott CE","Howe KL","Woodfine K","Spencer CC","Jones MC","Gillson C","Searle S","Zhou Y","Kokocinski F","McDonald L","Evans R","Phillips K","Atkinson A","Cooper R","Jones C","Hall RE","Andrews TD","Lloyd C","Ainscough R","Almeida JP","Ambrose KD","Anderson F","Andrew RW","Ashwell RI","Aubin K","Babbage AK","Bagguley CL","Bailey J","Beasley H","Bethel G","Bird CP","Bray-Allen S","Brown JY","Brown AJ","Buckley D","Burton J","Bye J","Carder C","Chapman JC","Clark SY","Clarke G","Clee C","Cobley V","Collier RE","Corby N","Coville GJ","Davies J","Deadman R","Dunn M","Earthrowl M","Ellington AG","Errington H","Frankish A","Frankland J","French L","Garner P","Garnett J","Gay L","Ghori MR","Gibson R","Gilby LM","Gillett W","Glithero RJ","Grafham DV","Griffiths C","Griffiths-Jones S","Grocock R","Hammond S","Harrison ES","Hart E","Haugen E","Heath PD","Holmes S","Holt K","Howden PJ","Hunt AR","Hunt SE","Hunter G","Isherwood J","James R","Johnson C","Johnson D","Joy A","Kay M","Kershaw JK","Kibukawa M","Kimberley AM","King A","Knights AJ","Lad H","Laird G","Lawlor S","Leongamornlert DA","Lloyd DM","Loveland J","Lovell J","Lush MJ","Lyne R","Martin S","Mashreghi-Mohammadi M","Matthews L","Matthews NS","McLaren S","Milne S","Mistry S","Moore MJ","Nickerson T","O'Dell CN","Oliver K","Palmeiri A","Palmer SA","Parker A","Patel D","Pearce AV","Peck AI","Pelan S","Phelps K","Phillimore BJ","Plumb R","Rajan J","Raymond C","Rouse G","Saenphimmachak C","Sehra HK","Sheridan E","Shownkeen R","Sims S","Skuce CD","Smith M","Steward C","Subramanian S","Sycamore N","Tracey A","Tromans A","Van Helmond Z","Wall M","Wallis JM","White S","Whitehead SL","Wilkinson JE","Willey DL","Williams H","Wilming L","Wray PW","Wu Z","Coulson A","Vaudin M","Sulston JE","Durbin R","Hubbard T","Wooster R","Dunham I","Carter NP","McVean G","Ross MT","Harrow J","Olson MV","Beck S","Rogers J","Bentley DR","Banerjee R","Bryant SP","Burford DC","Burrill WD","Clegg SM","Dhami P","Dovey O","Faulkner LM","Gribble SM","Langford CF","Pandian RD","Porter KM","Prigmore E"],"grantIds":["G0000107"],"grantAgencies":["Medical Research Council","Wellcome Trust"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Nature","journalShort":"Nature","day":18,"month":5,"year":2006,"meshHeadings":["Base Sequence","Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1","DNA Replication Timing","Disease","Gene Duplication","Genes","Genetic Variation","Genomics","Humans","Molecular Sequence Data","Open Reading Frames","Pseudogenes","Recombination, Genetic","Selection, Genetic","Sequence Analysis, DNA"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"The reference sequence for each human chromosome provides the framework for understanding genome function, variation and evolution.

We demonstrate that Mxi2 functions in nuclear shuttling of ERK1/2 by enhancing the nuclear accumulation of both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms in the absence of stimulation.

Mice lacking Sema4A exhibit enhanced angiogenesis in response to VEGF or inflammatory stimuli. In addition, binding and functional experiments revealed Plexin-D1 to be a receptor for Sema4A on endothelial cells, indicating that Sema4A exerts organ-specific activities via different receptor-mediated signaling pathways: via Plexin-D1 in the endothelial cells and via T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-2 in T cells.

Accordingly, kinase genes have been the first to be systematically analyzed in human tumors leading to the discovery that many oncogenes correspond to mutated kinases. In most cases the genetic alterations translate in constitutively active kinase proteins, which are amenable of therapeutic targeting. Tumours of the pancreas are aggressive neoplasms for which no effective therapeutic strategy is currently available. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a DNA-sequence analysis of a selected set of 35 kinase genes in a panel of 52 pancreatic exocrine neoplasms, including 36 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and 16 ampulla of Vater cancer. Among other changes we found somatic mutations in ATM, EGFR, EPHA3, EPHB2, and KIT, none of which was previously described in cancers. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Although the alterations identified require further experimental evaluation, the localization within defined protein domains indicates functional relevance for most of them. Some of the mutated genes, including the tyrosine kinases EPHA3 and EPHB2, are clearly amenable to pharmacological intervention and could represent novel therapeutic targets for these incurable cancers.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"18713744","pmcid":null,"title":"Ephrin-B2-induced cleavage of EphB2 receptor is mediated by matrix metalloproteinases to trigger cell repulsion.","authors":["Lin KT","Sloniowski S","Ethell DW","Ethell IM"],"grantIds":["MH67121","R01 MH067121","R01 MH067121-05"],"grantAgencies":["NIMH NIH HHS","NIMH NIH HHS","NIMH NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"The Journal of biological chemistry","journalShort":"J.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of EPHB2 to hereditary colorectal cancer. We screened for germline EPHB2 sequence variants in 116 population-based familial colorectal cancer cases by DNA sequencing. We then estimated the population frequencies and characterized the biological activities of the EPHB2 variants identified. Three novel nonsynonymous missense alterations were detected. Two of these variants (A438T and G787R) result in significant residue changes, while the third leads to a conservative substitution in the carboxy-terminal SAM domain (V945I). The former two variants were found once in the 116 cases, while the V945I variant was present in 2 cases. Genotyping of additional patients with colorectal cancer and control subjects revealed that A438T and G787R represent rare EPHB2 alleles. In vitro functional studies show that the G787R substitution, located in the kinase domain, causes impaired receptor kinase activity and is therefore pathogenic, whereas the A438T variant retains its receptor function and likely represents a neutral polymorphism. Tumor tissue from the G787R variant case manifested loss of heterozygosity, with loss of the wild-type allele, supporting a tumor suppressor role for EPHB2 in rare colorectal cancer cases.

Although HIC1 and ZNF189 did not fully satisfy our stringency criterion for replication, they were strongly associated with iCP in TRIMM analyses of the Norwegian triads. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Except for FLNB, HIC1 and ZNF189, maternal genes did not appear to influence the risk of clefting in our data. This is consistent with recent epidemiological findings showing no apparent difference between mother-to-offspring and father-to-offspring recurrence of clefts in these two populations. It is likely that fetal genes make the major genetic contribution to clefting risk in these populations, but we cannot rule out the possibility that maternal genes can affect risk through interactions with specific teratogens or fetal genes.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"19661068","pmcid":null,"title":"Peptide EphB2/CTF2 generated by the gamma-secretase processing of EphB2 receptor promotes tyrosine phosphorylation and cell surface localization of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors.","authors":["Xu J","Litterst C","Georgakopoulos A","Zaganas I","Robakis NK"],"grantIds":["AG-05138","AG-08200","AG-17926","P50 AG005138","P50 AG005138-25","R01 AG008200","R01 AG008200-18","R37 AG017926","R37 AG017926-09"],"grantAgencies":["NIA NIH HHS","NIA NIH HHS","NIA NIH HHS","NIA NIH HHS","NIA NIH HHS","NIA NIH HHS","NIA NIH HHS","NIA NIH HHS","NIA NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"The Journal of biological chemistry","journalShort":"J.

Recent evidence reveals that cytosolic peptides produced by the combined metalloproteinase/gamma-secretase processing of cell surface proteins function in signal transduction and protein phosphorylation. Here we show that peptide EphB2/CTF2 released to the cytosol by the gamma-secretase processing of EphB2 receptor, has tyrosine kinase activity, and directly phosphorylates the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunits in both cell lines and primary neuronal cultures. This phosphorylation occurs in the absence of Src kinases and is resistant to Src inhibitors revealing a novel pathway of NMDAR tyrosine phosphorylation independent of Src activity. EphB2/CTF2, but not a kinase-deficient mutant of EphB2/CTF2, promotes the cell surface expression of NMDAR. Because NMDAR plays central roles in synaptic plasticity and function, our results provide a potential link between the gamma-secretase function of presenilin 1 and learning and memory.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"17655843","pmcid":null,"title":"EGF receptor transactivation and PI3-kinase mediate stimulation of ERK by alpha(2A)-adrenoreceptor in intestinal epithelial cells: a role in wound healing.","authors":["Buffin-Meyer B","Crassous PA","Delage C","Denis C","Schaak S","Paris H"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"European journal of pharmacology","journalShort":"Eur.

Involved mechanisms are poorly understood and are not fully related to inhibition of cAMP production. Previous study using a clone of CaCo2 cells expressing the human alpha(2A)-adrenoreceptor (CaCo2-3B) showed that alpha(2)-adrenoreceptor agonists cause extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. Present work examines the signaling pathway triggering ERK activation and investigates the consequence of alpha(2A)-adrenoreceptor stimulation on cell migration. Treatment of CaCo2-3B with the alpha(2)-adrenoreceptor agonist 5-bromo-6-(2-imidazolin-2-ylamino) quinoxaline (UK14304) induces not only ERK, but also Akt phosphorylation. Both effects are strongly attenuated by inhibition or desensitization of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) blockade, heparin-binding-EGF neutralization or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) inhibitors. Conditioned medium from UK14304-treated CaCo2-3B stimulates ERK in parental CaCo2 by a mechanism sensitive to EGF receptor and PI3-kinase inhibitors. Exposure of CaCo2-3B to UK14304 accelerates the wound healing. This effect is abolished by heparin-binding-EGF neutralization but not by mitomycin C, indicating that it results probably from increased cell spreading and/or migration. In conclusion, alpha(2A)-adrenoreceptor activates ERK and Akt in intestinal cells by a common pathway which depends on PI3-kinase activation and results from EGF receptor transactivation, via an autocrine/paracrine pathway implying MMP activation and heparin-binding-EGF shedding. Therefore, alpha(2A)-adrenoreceptor could have a positive role in intestinal regeneration in vivo.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"18695888","pmcid":null,"title":"Overexpression of EphA4 gene and reduced expression of EphB2 gene correlates with liver metastasis in colorectal cancer.","authors":["Oshima T","Akaike M","Yoshihara K","Shiozawa M","Yamamoto N","Sato T","Akihito N","Nagano Y","Fujii S","Kunisaki C","Wada N","Rino Y","Tanaka K","Masuda M","Imada T"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"International journal of oncology","journalShort":"Int.

We studied surgical specimens of cancer tissue and adjacent normal mucosa obtained from 205 patients with untreated colorectal cancer. The relative expression levels of EphA4 and EphB2 mRNA in the specimens were measured by quantitative real-time, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. The relative expression level of EphA4 mRNA was higher in the presence than in the absence of liver metastasis, whereas the relative expression levels of EphB2 mRNA were similar. Analysis of the relationship between clinicopathological features and gene expression showed that high expression of the EphA4 gene and low expression of the EphB2 gene correlated with liver metastasis. There was no correlation between EphA4 and EphB2 gene expression.

Adhesion experiments with monocytic cells were performed on ECs that overexpressed either full-length ephrin-B2 or cytoplasmically truncated ephrin-B2 (DeltaC-ephrin-B2). Atomic force microscopy confirmed similar adhesive strengths of EphBR-expressing J774 cells to ECs that either overexpressed full-length ephrin-B2 or truncated DeltaC-ephrin-B2 (1-minute interaction). Yet, adhesion experiments under static or flow conditions for 30 minutes demonstrated the preferential adhesion of monocytic cells to ECs that overexpressed full-length ephrin-B2 but not to DeltaC-ephrin-B2 or to ECs that had been mock transduced. Adhesion was blocked by ephrin-B2-specific and EphBR-specific antibodies. Correspondingly, adhesion of EphB4-receptor-overexpressing monocytes to ephrin-B2-positive ECs was further augmented. Trafficking experiments of cell-surface molecules revealed that, prior to internalization, the resulting EphB4-receptor-ephrin-B2 complex translocated from the luminal surface to inter-endothelial junctions.

Loss of EphB2 is seen in most colorectal cancers and correlates with poor prognosis. In this study, we investigated the effects of two levels of EphB2 expression on cell migration and invasion in a colon cancer cell line and on the growth of tumour xenografts. METHODS: An EphB2-negative colon cancer cell line (LIM2405) was transfected with a full-length EphB2 cDNA in a vector designed to respond to the drug tetracycline. The effect of two levels of EphB2 expression on the ability of cells to migrate through a porous barrier in response to a chemo-attractant and to invade through artificial basement membranes was tested in vitro. Finally, the effects of two expression levels of EphB2 on tumour growth using an in vivo model of colonic tumour xenograft in a mouse model were assessed. RESULTS: Expression of moderate levels of EphB2 significantly reduced the migration of tumour cells compared to control (p < 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test). Expression of high levels of EphB2 further reduced migration of tumour cells (p < 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test). Similarly, expression of EphB2 markedly reduces the invasive ability of tumour cells. The in vivo model of tumour growth showed that tumours with the highest level of EphB2 expression had a reduced risk of reaching a 10-mm size (defined event) compared with the control group (Cox regression, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.052, 95% CI 0.005-0.550; p = 0.014). Tumours derived from EphB2 expressing cells had a significantly reduced number of mitotic figures (p < 0.05) and an increased number of apoptotic cells (p < 0.05) compared to tumours from control cells. CONCLUSION: Even a moderate level of EphB2 expression has effects on tumour cells which results in reduced migration and invasiveness and slows the growth of colonic tumour implants in an in vivo model.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"19962662","pmcid":null,"title":"Proliferation and tumor suppression: not mutually exclusive for Eph receptors.","authors":["Noberini R","Pasquale EB"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Cancer cell","journalShort":"Cancer Cell","day":8,"month":12,"year":2009,"meshHeadings":["Adenoma","Animals","Cell Proliferation","Humans","Intestinal Neoplasms","Mice","Mice, Knockout","Receptor, EphB2"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Eph receptors are important but controversial regulators of cancer development.

The idiosyncratic function of Ephs, membrane-bound receptor kinases, as extracellular signaling ligands, has not been extensively studied. This prompted us to explore the transcriptional targets regulated by Ephs acting solely as ligands. To define the ligand function of EphB2 in human epidermal keratinocytes, we treated these cells with EphB2 as Fc-conjugate dimmers, which thus act exclusively as extracellular ligands. We compared the EphB2 and EFNA4 effects during a 48 h time course, using transcriptional profiling. We found that EphB2, acting as a ligand, promotes epidermal differentiation. For example, EphB2 induces expression of markers of epidermal differentiation, including keratins KRT1 and KRT10, SPRRs, desmosomal proteins and cell cycle inhibitors, while suppressing basal layer markers, integrins and cell cycle proteins. The effects of EphB2 are delayed relative to those of EFNA4. Unlike EFNA4, EphB2 did not induce lipid metabolism proteins, this particular aspect of epidermal differentiation seems not to be regulated by EphB2.

We report that EphB2 induces a form of cell death that does not involve the formation of apoptotic bodies or nuclear fragmentation and is instead accompanied by extensive vacuolization. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrates cytoplasmic vacuoles in EphB2-overexpressing cells that resembled autophagosomes. Using an EYFP-LC3 fusion protein and immunoblotting, we detected LC3 aggregation and conversion from form I to form II, both hallmarks of autophagy, in EphB2-transfected cells. Silencing of the autophagy regulating genes ATG5 or ATG7 using shRNAs, strongly prevented EphB2-induced cell death, further confirming its autophagic nature. EphB2 expression results in mitochondrial depolarization and translocation of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol. Mapping of signaling pathways revealed novel information about the mechanisms of action of EphB2. We demonstrated that the MAPK pathway is important in the pro-death action of EphB2, through ERK1/2 phosphorylation and inhibition of this pathway using PD98059 counters EphB2-driven cell death. In addition, we found that inhibition of class III PI3K pathway, using the autophagy inhibitor 3MA, but not class I PI3K inhibition using LY294002, also effectively blocks EphB2- induced cell death.

In conclusion, the EphB2 receptor induces an autophagic cell death that is mediated through the ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt pathways.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"23383108","pmcid":"3559347","title":"Modulation of cytokine release and gene expression by the immunosuppressive domain of gp41 of HIV-1.","authors":["Denner J","Eschricht M","Lauck M","Semaan M","Schlaermann P","Ryu H","Akyüz L"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"PloS one","journalShort":"PLoS ONE","day":5,"month":2,"year":2013,"meshHeadings":["Amino Acid Sequence","Cytokines","Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay","Gene Expression Regulation","HIV Envelope Protein gp41","HIV-1","Humans","Leukocytes, Mononuclear","Microarray Analysis","Molecular Sequence Data","Peptides","Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide","Protein Structure, Tertiary","Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"The transmembrane envelope protein gp41 of the human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 plays an important role during infection allowing fusion of the viral and cellular membrane. In addition, there is increasing evidence that gp41 may contribute to the immunodeficiency induced by HIV-1. Recombinant gp41 and a synthetic peptide corresponding to a highly conserved domain in gp41, the immunosuppressive (isu) domain, have been shown to inhibit mitogen-induced activation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and to increase release of IL-6 and IL-10 from these cells. We recently reported that a single mutation in the isu domain of gp41 abrogated the immunosuppressive properties and that HIV-1 sequences containing such abrogating mutations had never been isolated from infected individuals. Here, we studied the influence of the isu peptide on the release of 66 cytokines and the expression of 27,000 genes in PBMCs. Incubation of PBMCs with isu peptide homopolymers increased the expression of 16 cytokines among them IL-6 and IL-10, and decreased that of IL-2 and CXCL9. Interestingly, the extend of cytokine modulation was donor-dependent. Among the genes up-regulated were IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 but also MMP-1, TREM-1 and IL-1beta. Most importantly, genes involved in innate immunity such as FCN1 and SEPP1 were found down-regulated. Many changes in cytokine expression demonstrated in our experiments were also found in HIV-1 infected individuals. These data indicate that the isu domain of gp41 has a broad impact on gene expression and cytokine release and therefore may be involved in HIV-1 induced immunopathogenesis.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"19454503","pmcid":null,"title":"Methylation analysis of BRCA1, RASSF1, GSTP1 and EPHB2 promoters in prostate biopsies according to different degrees of malignancy.","authors":["Rabiau N","Thiam MO","Satih S","Guy L","Kemeny JL","Boiteux JP","Fontana L","Bignon YJ","Bernard-Gallon D"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"In vivo (Athens, Greece)","journalShort":"In Vivo","day":20,"month":5,"year":2009,"meshHeadings":["Base Sequence","DNA Methylation","DNA Primers","Genes, BRCA1","Glutathione S-Transferase pi","Humans","Male","Polymerase Chain Reaction","Promoter Regions, Genetic","Prostatic Neoplasms","Receptor, EphB2","Tumor Suppressor Proteins"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States.

In medulloblastoma, invading tumor cells characteristically lead to early recurrence and a decreased prognosis. Based on kinase-activity profiling data published recently, we hypothesized a key role for the Eph/ephrin signaling system in medulloblastoma invasion. In primary medulloblastoma samples, a significantly higher expression of EphB2 and the ligand ephrin-B1 was observed compared with normal cerebellum. Furthermore, medulloblastoma cell lines showed high expression of EphA2, EphB2, and EphB4. Stimulation of medulloblastoma cells with ephrin-B1 resulted in a marked decrease in in vitro cell adhesion and an increase in the invasion capacity of cells expressing high levels of EphB2. The cell lines that showed an ephrin-B1-induced phenotype possessed increased levels of phosphorylated EphB2 and, to a lesser extent, EphB4 after stimulation. Knockdown of EphB2 expression by short hairpin RNA completely abolished ephrin ligand-induced effects on adhesion and migration. Analysis of signal transduction identified p38, Erk, and mTOR as downstream signaling mediators potentially inducing the ephrin-B1 phenotype. In conclusion, the observed deregulation of Eph/ephrin expression in medulloblastoma enhances the invasive phenotype, suggesting a potential role in local tumor cell invasion and the formation of metastases.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"21987572","pmcid":null,"title":"Ubiquitin ligase substrate identification through quantitative proteomics at both the protein and peptide levels.","authors":["Lee KA","Hammerle LP","Andrews PS","Stokes MP","Mustelin T","Silva JC","Black RA","Doedens JR"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"The Journal of biological chemistry","journalShort":"J.

HRD1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, has been implicated in rheumatoid arthritis, but no disease-relevant substrates have been identified. To identify these substrates, we have taken both peptide and protein level approaches to enrich for ubiquitinated proteins in the presence and absence of HRD1. At the protein level, a two-step strategy was taken using cells expressing His(6)-tagged ubiquitin, enriching proteins first based on their ubiquitination and second based on the His tag with protein identification by LC-MS/MS. Application of this method resulted in identification and quantification of more than 400 ubiquitinated proteins, a fraction of which were found to be sensitive to HRD1 and were therefore deemed candidate substrates. In a second approach, ubiquitinated peptides were enriched after tryptic digestion by peptide immunoprecipitation using an antibody specific for the diglycine-labeled internal lysine residue indicative of protein ubiquitination, with peptides and ubiquitination sites identified by LC-MS/MS. Peptide immunoprecipitation resulted in identification of over 1800 ubiquitinated peptides on over 900 proteins in each study, with several proteins emerging as sensitive to HRD1 levels. Notably, significant overlap exists between the HRD1 substrates identified by the protein-based and the peptide-based strategies, with clear cross-validation apparent both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating the effectiveness of both strategies and furthering our understanding of HRD1 biology.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"23835497","pmcid":null,"title":"MicroRNA-128 promotes cell-cell adhesion in U87 glioma cells via regulation of EphB2.","authors":["Lin L","Chen X","Peng X","Zhou J","Kung HF","Lin MC","Jiang S"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Oncology reports","journalShort":"Oncol.

The varied biological effects of EPH receptors are mediated in part by the expression of these proteins and their intracellular binding proteins. The ability of EPH molecules to form heterodimers within their own class has been suggested, although not exhaustively characterized. We have clarified this phenomenon by showing that EPHB6, a kinase-deficient receptor, can interact with EPHB2 in mammalian cells, and more significantly EPHB6 interacts with EPHA2. However, EPHB6 does not interact with another kinase-deficient receptor, EPHA10. The interaction between EPHB6 and EPHA2 is the first demonstration of an A-type receptor interacting with a B-type receptor. Furthermore, we correlated relative expression of EPHB6, EPHB2 and EPHA2 with non-invasive and invasive phenotypes of breast tumor cell lines. Our results indicate that tumor invasiveness-suppressing activity of EPHB6 is mediated by its ability to sequester other kinase-sufficient and oncogenic EPH receptors. These observations suggest that cellular phenotypes may, in part, be attributed to a combinatorial expression of EPH receptors and heteromeric interactions among the same class, as well as between two classes, of EPH receptors. Our results also suggest that EPHA10 may transduce signals by interacting with other kinase-sufficient receptors in a similar manner.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"22374425","pmcid":null,"title":"Expression of EphrinB2 and EphB4 in glioma tissues correlated to the progression of glioma and the prognosis of glioblastoma patients.","authors":["Tu Y","He S","Fu J","Li G","Xu R","Lu H","Deng J"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico","journalShort":"Clin Transl Oncol","day":29,"month":3,"year":2012,"meshHeadings":["Adult","Aged","Brain Neoplasms","Disease Progression","Ephrin-B2","Female","Glioblastoma","Glioma","Humans","Immunohistochemistry","Male","Middle Aged","Neoplasm Staging","Prognosis","Receptor, EphB4","Tissue Distribution","Tumor Markers, Biological"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The ligand EphrinB2 and the corresponding receptor EphB4 are up-regulated and involved in tumour growth in various human cancers.

METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining was performed to detect the expression patterns of EphrinB2 and EphB4 in the biopsies from 96 patients with primary gliomas. Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate the prognosis of patients. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the expression of EphrinB2 was significantly correlated with that of EphB4 (r=0.86, p=0.002).

We studied EphB2 gain of function and loss of function in glioblastoma-derived stem-like neurospheres, whose in vivo growth pattern closely replicates human GBM. EphB2 expression stimulated GBM neurosphere cell migration and invasion, and inhibited neurosphere cell proliferation in vitro. In parallel, EphB2 silencing increased tumor cell proliferation and decreased tumor cell migration. EphB2 was found to increase tumor cell invasion in vivo using an internally controlled dual-fluorescent xenograft model. Xenografts derived from EphB2-overexpressing GBM neurospheres also showed decreased cellular proliferation. The non-receptor tyrosine kinase focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was found to be co-associated with and highly activated by EphB2 expression, and FAK activation facilitated focal adhesion formation, cytoskeleton structure change and cell migration in EphB2-expressing GBM neurosphere cells. Taken together, our findings indicate that EphB2 has pro-invasive and anti-proliferative actions in GBM stem-like neurospheres mediated, in part, by interactions between EphB2 receptors and FAK.

METHODS: Using expression arrays, we investigated EPHB2 in MM tumors compared with normal mesothelium. EPHB2 and downstream target expression were evaluated using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting methods. The biological significance of EPHB2 in MM was evaluated using in vitro functional assays with and without targeting by EPHB2-short hairpin RNA or blocking peptide in two mesothelioma cell lines, HP-1 and H2595. RESULTS: EPHB2 is overexpressed in all MM cell lines, but not in benign mesothelial cells, and is significantly elevated in MM tumor tissue compared with matched normal peritoneum. Targeted knockdown of EPHB2 in HP-1 and H2595 cell lines reduced its expression and that of EPHB2 downstream targets such as matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor, whereas caspase 2 and caspase 8 had increased expression. Inhibition of EPHB2 resulted in a significant decrease in scratch closure (1.25-fold-1.8-fold), proliferation (1.5-fold), and invasion (1.7-fold-1.8-fold) compared with the controls.

Phenotypic and transcriptome analysis determined that the clones with enhanced intestinal contribution expressed high levels of Ephrin type B receptor 2 (EphB2). Intestinal explants demonstrated proliferation of the engrafted cells and ability to generate crypt-like structures in vitro still expressing EphB2. Additional transplants based on BMSC EphB2 expression demonstrated that, at 7 d post-transplant, the EphB2(high) BMSCs engrafted in the ISC region at levels of 2.1 ± 0.2%, while control EphB2(low) BMSCs engrafted at 0.3 ± 0.1% (P<0.01). Therefore we identified a marker for isolating and culturing an expandable subpopulation of BMSCs with enhanced intestinal homing and contribution to the ISC region.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"23711177","pmcid":null,"title":"EphB and Ephrin-B interactions mediate human mesenchymal stem cell suppression of activated T-cells.","authors":["Nguyen TM","Arthur A","Hayball JD","Gronthos S"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Stem cells and development","journalShort":"Stem Cells Dev.","day":15,"month":10,"year":2013,"meshHeadings":["Cell Proliferation","Coculture Techniques","Ephrin-B2","Gene Expression Regulation","Humans","Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase","Interferon-gamma","Interleukin-17","Interleukin-2","Lymphocyte Activation","Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed","Mesenchymal Stromal Cells","Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II","Phosphorylation","Primary Cell Culture","RNA, Small Interfering","Receptor, EphB2","Receptor, EphB4","Signal Transduction","T-Lymphocytes","Transforming Growth Factor beta1"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSC) express the contact-dependent erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular (Eph) receptor tyrosine kinase family and their cognate ephrin ligands, which are known to regulate thymocyte maturation and selection, T-cell transendothelial migration, activation, co-stimulation, and proliferation. However, the contribution of Eph/ephrin molecules in mediating human MSC suppression of activated T-cells remains to be determined. In the present study, we showed that EphB2 and ephrin-B2 are expressed by ex vivo expanded MSC, while the corresponding ligands, ephrin-B1 and EphB4, respectively, are highly expressed by T-cells. Initial studies demonstrated that EphB2-Fc and ephrin-B2-Fc molecules suppressed T-cell proliferation in allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assays compared with human IgG-treated controls. While the addition of a third-party MSC population demonstrated dramatic suppression of T-cell proliferation responses in the MLR, blocking the function of EphB2 or EphB4 receptors using inhibitor binding peptides significantly increased T-cell proliferation. Consistent with these observations, shRNA EphB2 or ephrin-B2 knockdown expression in MSC reduced their ability to inhibit T-cell proliferation. Importantly, the expression of immunosuppressive factors, indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase, transforming growth factor-β1, and inducible nitric oxide synthase expressed by MSC, was up-regulated after stimulation with EphB4 and ephrin-B1 in the presence of interferon (IFN)-γ, compared with untreated controls. Conversely, key factors involved in T-cell activation and proliferation, such as interleukin (IL)-2, IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL-17, were down-regulated by T-cells treated with EphB2 or ephrin-B2 compared with untreated controls. Studies utilizing signaling inhibitors revealed that inhibition of T-cell proliferation is partly mediated through EphB2-induced ephrin-B1 reverse signaling or ephrin-B2-mediated EphB4 forward signaling by activating Src, PI3Kinase, Abl, and JNK kinase pathways, activated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Taken together, these observations suggest that EphB/ephrin-B interactions play an important role in mediating human MSC inhibition of activated T cells.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"24211352","pmcid":null,"title":"Role of the EphB2 receptor in autophagy, apoptosis and invasion in human breast cancer cells.","authors":["Chukkapalli S","Amessou M","Dilly AK","Dekhil H","Zhao J","Liu Q","Bejna A","Thomas RD","Bandyopadhyay S","Bismar TA","Neill D","Azoulay L","Batist G","Kandouz M"],"grantIds":["P30CA022453"],"grantAgencies":["NCI NIH HHS","Canadian Institutes of Health Research"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Experimental cell research","journalShort":"Exp.

Here, we examined the expression and role of the B-type Eph receptor EphB2 in breast cancers. By immunohistochemistry using a progression tissue microarray of human clinical samples, we found EphB2 to be expressed in benign tissues, but strongly increased in cancers particularly in invasive and metastatic carcinomas. Subsequently, we found evidence that EphB2, whose expression varies in established cell breast lines, possesses multiple functions. First, the use of a DOX-inducible system to restore EphB2 function to low expressers resulted in decreased tumor growth in vitro and in vivo, while its siRNA-mediated silencing in high expressers increased growth. This function involves the onset of apoptotic death paralleled by caspases 3 and 9 activation. Second, EphB2 was also found to induce autophagy, as assessed by immunofluorescence and/or immunoblotting examination of the LC3, ATG5 and ATG12 markers. Third, EphB2 also has a pro-invasive function in breast cancer cells that involves the regulation of MMP2 and MMP9 metalloproteases and can be blocked by treatment with respective neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, EphB2-induced invasion is kinase-dependent and is impeded in cells expressing a kinase-dead mutant EphB2. In summary, we identified a mechanism involving a triple role for EphB2 in breast cancer progression, whereby it regulates apoptosis, autophagy, and invasion.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"24803541","pmcid":null,"title":"EphB2 contributes to human naive B-cell activation and is regulated by miR-185.","authors":["Yu M","Liang W","Wen S","Zhao T","Zhu MX","Li HH","Long Q","Wang M","Cheng X","Liao YH","Yuan J"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology","journalShort":"FASEB J.","day":1,"month":8,"year":2014,"meshHeadings":["B-Lymphocytes","Ephrin-B1","Ephrin-B2","Humans","Immunoglobulin G","Immunoglobulin M","Lymphocyte Activation","MicroRNAs","RNA Interference","RNA, Messenger","RNA, Small Interfering","Receptor, EphB2","Receptor, Notch1","Signal Transduction","Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"EphB2 is an important member of the receptor tyrosine kinases. Recently, EphB2 was shown to facilitate T-cell migration and monocyte activation. However, the effects of EphB2 on B cells remain unknown. In this study, the expression of EphB2 on B cells was tested by Western blot, and the roles of EphB2 in B-cell proliferation, cytokine secretion, and immunoglobulin (Ig) production were evaluated using EphB2 siRNA interference in human B cells from healthy volunteers. Our study revealed that EphB2 was distributed on naive B cells and was up-regulated on activated B cells. Moreover, B-cell proliferation (decreased by 22%, P<0.05), TNF-α secretion (decreased by 40%, P<0.01) and IgG production (decreased by 26%, P < 0.05) were depressed concordantly with the down-regulated EphB2 expression. Subsequently, we screened microRNAs that could regulate EphB2 expression in B cells, and discovered that miR-185 directly targeted to EphB2 mRNA and suppressed its expression. Furthermore, miR-185 overexpression inhibited B-cell activation, and the inhibitor of miR-185 enhanced B-cell activation. Moreover, abatement of EphB2 through miR-185 mimics or EphB2 siRNA attenuated the activation of Src-p65 and Notch1 signaling pathways in human B cells. Our study first suggested that EphB2 was involved in human naive B cell activation through Src-p65 and Notch1 signaling pathways and could be regulated by miR-185.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"24222164","pmcid":null,"title":"A9 region in EPHB2 mutation is frequent in tumors with microsatellite instability.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 481 patients with CRC were examined. MSI (NCI criteria) and EPHB2 were analyzed using PCR and fragment analysis software. RESULTS: EPHB2 mutation was detected in 3.1% of patients. Mutation of EPHB2 was associated with location and with MSI status. We considered low instability (L-MSI) when only one marker showed instability, high instability (H-MSI) when two or more markers were positive and microsatelllite stable (MSS) when no instability was detected. The stratified analysis of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in MSI according to EPHB2 status revealed no statistically significant differences. However, the risk of recurrence of H-MSI tumors with EPHB2 mutation carriers was 3.6-times higher than in non-mutation carriers. CONCLUSION: The frequency of EPHB2 mutation is higher in patients with H-MSI than MSS tumors. Promising results were found regarding the prognostic influence of EPHB2 in H-MSI.","affiliation":[]}]}
