The product of this gene is an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of retinoic acid (RA) from retinaldehyde. Retinoic acid, the active derivative of vitamin A (retinol), is a hormonal signaling molecule that functions in developing and adult tissues. The studies of a similar mouse gene suggest that this enzyme and the cytochrome CYP26A1, concurrently establish local embryonic retinoic acid levels which facilitate posterior organ development and prevent spina bifida. Four transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been identified for this gene.","taxon":{"id":"NCBITaxon:9606","label":"Homo

The methodologies used were 1) literature search for proteins reported to occur in plasma or serum; 2) multidimensional chromatography of proteins followed by two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectroscopy (MS) identification of resolved proteins; 3) tryptic digestion and multidimensional chromatography of peptides followed by MS identification; and 4) tryptic digestion and multidimensional chromatography of peptides from low-molecular-mass plasma components followed by MS identification. Of 1,175 nonredundant gene products, 195 were included in more than one of the four input datasets. Only 46 appeared in all four. Predictions of signal sequence and transmembrane domain occurrence, as well as Genome Ontology annotation assignments, allowed characterization of the nonredundant list and comparison of the data sources. The \"nonproteomic\" literature (468 input proteins) is strongly biased toward signal sequence-containing extracellular proteins, while the three proteomics methods showed a much higher representation of cellular proteins, including nuclear, cytoplasmic, and kinesin complex proteins. Cytokines and protein hormones were almost completely absent from the proteomics data (presumably due to low abundance), while categories like DNA-binding proteins were almost entirely absent from the literature data (perhaps unexpected and therefore not sought). Most major categories of proteins in the human proteome are represented in plasma, with the distribution at successively deeper layers shifting from mostly extracellular to a distribution more like the whole (primarily cellular) proteome.

Severe vitamin A deprivation in rodents results in maternal infertility, precluding a thorough investigation of the role of RA during embryogenesis. Here we show that production of RA by the retinaldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (Raldh2) enzyme is required for mouse embryo survival and early morphogenesis. Raldh2 is an NAD-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase with high substrate specificity for retinaldehyde. Its pattern of expression during mouse development has suggested that it may be responsible for embryonic RA synthesis. We generated a targeted disruption of the mouse Raldh2 gene and found that Raldh2-/- embryos, which die at midgestation without undergoing axial rotation (body turning), exhibit shortening along the anterioposterior axis and do not form limb buds. Their heart consists of a single, medial, dilated cavity. Their frontonasal region is truncated and their otocysts are severely reduced. These defects result from a block in embryonic RA synthesis, as shown by the lack of activity of RA-responsive transgenes, the altered expression of an RA-target homeobox gene and the near full rescue of the mutant phenotype by maternal RA administration. Our data establish that RA synthesized by the post-implantation mammalian embryo is an essential developmental hormone whose lack leads to early embryo death.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"21139048","pmcid":"3047152","title":"Mass spectrometric analysis of lysine ubiquitylation reveals promiscuity at site level.","authors":["Danielsen JM","Sylvestersen KB","Bekker-Jensen S","Szklarczyk D","Poulsen JW","Horn H","Jensen LJ","Mailand N","Nielsen ML"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP","journalShort":"Mol.

This observation is likely to relate to the findings that TAL1 and LMO are highly synergistic in T-cell tumorigenesis in double-transgenic mice. To understand the molecular mechanisms of functional synergy between TAL1 and LMO in tumorigenesis and transcriptional regulation, we tried to identify downstream target genes regulated by TAL1 and LMO by a subtractive PCR method. One of the isolated genes, that for retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH2), was regularly expressed in most of the T-ALL cell lines that coexpressed TAL1 and LMO. Exogenously transfected TAL1 and LMO, but not either alone, induced RALDH2 expression in a T-ALL cell line, HPB-ALL, not expressing endogeneous TAL1 or LMO. The RALDH2 transcripts in T-ALL were, however, mostly initiated within the second intron. Promoter analysis revealed that a GATA site in a cryptic promoter in the second intron was essential and sufficient for the TAL1- and LMO-dependent transcriptional activation, and GATA3 binds to this site. In addition, forced expression of GATA3 potentiated the induction of RALDH2 by TAL1 and LMO, and these three factors formed a complex in vivo. Furthermore, a TAL1 mutant not binding to DNA also activated the transcription of RALDH2 in the presence of LMO and GATA3. Collectively, we have identified the RALDH2 gene as a first example of direct transcriptional target genes regulated by TAL1 and LMO in T-ALL. In this case, TAL1 and LMO act as cofactors for GATA3 to activate the transcription of RALDH2.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"8663198","pmcid":null,"title":"Cloning of a cDNA encoding an aldehyde dehydrogenase and its expression in Escherichia coli.

Inactivation of genes in the RA pathway causes renal agenesis in mice; however, the impact of retinoids on human kidney development is unknown. To resolve this, we tested for associations between variants of genes involved in RA metabolism (ALDH1A2, CYP26A1, and CYP26B1) and kidney size among normal newborns. Homozygosity for a common (1 in 5) variant, rs7169289(G), within an Sp1 transcription factor motif of the ALDH1A2 gene, showed a significant 22% increase in newborn kidney volume when adjusted for body surface area. Infants bearing this allele had higher umbilical cord blood RA levels compared to those with homozygous wild-type ALDH1A2 rs7169289(A) alleles. Furthermore, the effect of the rs7169289(G) variant was evident in subgroups with or without a previously reported hypomorphic RET 1476(A) proto-oncogene allele that is critical in determining final nephron number. As maternal vitamin A deficiency is widespread in developing countries and may compromise availability of retinol for fetal RA synthesis, our study suggests that the ALDH1A2 rs7169289(G) variant might be protective for such individuals.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"16237707","pmcid":null,"title":"Analysis of ALDH1A2, CYP26A1, CYP26B1, CRABP1, and CRABP2 in human neural tube defects suggests a possible association with alleles in ALDH1A2.","authors":["Deak KL","Dickerson ME","Linney E","Enterline DS","George TM","Melvin EC","Graham FL","Siegel DG","Hammock P","Mehltretter L","Bassuk AG","Kessler JA","Gilbert JR","Speer MC","NTD Collaborative Group"],"grantIds":["ES11375","ES11961","NS39818"],"grantAgencies":["NIEHS NIH HHS","NIEHS NIH HHS","NINDS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Birth defects research.

Using a human ex vivo model of allergic inflammation by coincubating IgE receptor-activated mast cells (MCs) with blood basophils, we observed prominent induction of a protein that was identified as RALDH2 by mass spectroscopy. RALDH2 was selectively induced in basophils by MC-derived interleukin-3 (IL-3) involving PI3-kinase and NF-kappaB pathways. Importantly, neither constitutive nor inducible RALDH2 expression was detectable in any other human myeloid or lymphoid leukocyte, including dendritic cells. RA generated by RALDH2 in basophils modulates IL-3-induced gene expression in an autocrine manner, providing positive (CD25) as well as negative (granzyme B) regulation. It also acts in a paracrine fashion on T-helper cells promoting the expression of CD38 and alpha4/beta7 integrins. Furthermore, RA derived from IL-3-activated basophils provides a novel mechanism of Th2 polarization. Thus, RA must be viewed as a tightly controlled basophil-derived mediator with a high potential for regulating diverse functions of immune and resident cells in allergic diseases and other Th2-type immune responses.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"11953746","pmcid":null,"title":"Genetic evidence that oxidative derivatives of retinoic acid are not involved in retinoid signaling during mouse development.","authors":["Niederreither K","Abu-Abed S","Schuhbaur B","Petkovich M","Chambon P","Dollé P"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Nature genetics","journalShort":"Nat.

The Cyp26a1 (cytochrome p450, 26) protein metabolizes retinoic acid into more polar hydroxylated and oxidized derivatives. Whether some of these derivatives are biologically active metabolites has been debated. Cyp26a1(-/-) mouse fetuses have lethal morphogenetic phenotypes mimicking those generated by excess retinoic acid administration, indicating that human CYP26A1 may be essential in controlling retinoic acid levels during development. This hypothesis suggests that the Cyp26a1(-/-) phenotype could be rescued under conditions in which embryonic retinoic acid levels are decreased. We show that Cyp26a1(-/-) mice are phenotypically rescued by heterozygous disruption of Aldh1a2 (also known as Raldh2), which encodes a retinaldehyde dehydrogenase responsible for the synthesis of retinoic acid during early embryonic development. Aldh1a2 haploinsufficiency prevents the appearance of spina bifida and rescues the development of posterior structures (sacral/caudal vertebrae, hindgut, urogenital tract), while partly preventing cervical vertebral transformations and hindbrain pattern alterations in Cyp26a1(-/-) mice.

In rodents, moderate maternal vitamin A deficiency leads to subtle morphogenetic defects and inactivation of RA pathway genes causes major disturbances of embryogenesis. In this study, we quantified RA in umbilical cord blood of 145 healthy full-term Caucasian infants from Montreal. Sixty seven percent of values were <10 nmol/L (84 were <0.07 nmol/L) and 33% had moderate or high levels. Variation in RA could not be explained by parallel variation in its precursor, retinol (ROL). However, we found that the (A) allele of the rs12591551 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the ALDH1A2 gene (ALDH1A2rs12591551(A)), occurring in 19% of newborns, was associated with 2.5-fold higher serum RA levels. ALDH1A2 encodes retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (RALDH) 2, which synthesizes RA in fetal tissues. We also found that homozygosity for the (A) allele of the rs12724719 SNP in the CRABP2 gene (CRABP2rs12724719(A/A)) was associated with 4.4-fold increase in umbilical cord serum RA. CRABP2 facilitates RA binding to its cognate receptor complex and transfer to the nucleus. We hypothesize that individual variation in RA pathway genes may account for subtle variations in RA-dependent human embryogenesis.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"19886994","pmcid":"2779186","title":"ALDH1A2 (RALDH2) genetic variation in human congenital heart disease.","authors":["Pavan M","Ruiz VF","Silva FA","Sobreira TJ","Cravo RM","Vasconcelos M","Marques LP","Mesquita SM","Krieger JE","Lopes AA","Oliveira PS","Pereira AC","Xavier-Neto J"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"BMC medical genetics","journalShort":"BMC Med.

Since conversion of retinaldehyde to RA by retinaldehyde dehydrogenase type II (ALDH1A2, a.k.a RALDH2) is critical for cardiac development, we screened patients with congenital heart disease (CHDs) for genetic variation at the ALDH1A2 locus. METHODS: One-hundred and thirty-three CHD patients were screened for genetic variation at the ALDH1A2 locus through bi-directional sequencing. In addition, six SNPs (rs2704188, rs1441815, rs3784259, rs1530293, rs1899430) at the same locus were studied using a TDT-based association approach in 101 CHD trios. Observed mutations were modeled through molecular mechanics (MM) simulations using the AMBER 9 package, Sander and Pmemd programs. Sequence conservation of observed mutations was evaluated through phylogenetic tree construction from ungapped alignments containing ALDH8 s, ALDH1Ls, ALDH1 s and ALDH2 s. Trees were generated by the Neighbor Joining method. Variations potentially affecting splicing mechanisms were cloned and functional assays were designed to test splicing alterations using the pSPL3 splicing assay. RESULTS: We describe in Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) the mutations Ala151Ser and Ile157Thr that change non-polar to polar residues at exon 4. Exon 4 encodes part of the highly-conserved tetramerization domain, a structural motif required for ALDH oligomerization. Molecular mechanics simulation studies of the two mutations indicate that they hinder tetramerization. We determined that the SNP rs16939660, previously associated with spina bifida and observed in patients with TOF, does not affect splicing. Moreover, association studies performed with classical models and with the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) design using single marker genotype, or haplotype information do not show differences between cases and controls. CONCLUSION: In summary, our screen indicates that ALDH1A2 genetic variation is present in TOF patients, suggesting a possible causal role for this gene in rare cases of human CHD, but does not support the hypothesis that variation at the ALDH1A2 locus is a significant modifier of the risk for CHD in humans.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"12477932","pmcid":null,"title":"Generation and initial analysis of more than 15,000 full-length human and mouse cDNA sequences.","authors":["Strausberg RL","Feingold EA","Grouse LH","Derge JG","Klausner RD","Collins FS","Wagner L","Shenmen CM","Schuler GD","Altschul SF","Zeeberg B","Buetow KH","Schaefer CF","Bhat NK","Hopkins RF","Jordan H","Moore T","Max SI","Wang J","Hsieh F","Diatchenko L","Marusina K","Farmer AA","Rubin GM","Hong L","Stapleton M","Soares MB","Bonaldo MF","Casavant TL","Scheetz TE","Brownstein MJ","Usdin TB","Toshiyuki S","Carninci P","Prange C","Raha SS","Loquellano NA","Peters GJ","Abramson RD","Mullahy SJ","Bosak SA","McEwan PJ","McKernan KJ","Malek JA","Gunaratne PH","Richards S","Worley KC","Hale S","Garcia AM","Gay LJ","Hulyk SW","Villalon DK","Muzny DM","Sodergren EJ","Lu X","Gibbs RA","Fahey J","Helton E","Ketteman M","Madan A","Rodrigues S","Sanchez A","Whiting M","Madan A","Young AC","Shevchenko Y","Bouffard GG","Blakesley RW","Touchman JW","Green ED","Dickson MC","Rodriguez AC","Grimwood J","Schmutz J","Myers RM","Butterfield YS","Krzywinski MI","Skalska U","Smailus DE","Schnerch A","Schein JE","Jones SJ","Marra MA","Mammalian Gene Collection Program Team"],"grantIds":["U54 HG003273"],"grantAgencies":["NHGRI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","journalShort":"Proc.

Of the 271 genes that were induced by 5-aza-dC treatment, 25 also displayed reduced expression in primary prostate tumors compared with normal prostate tissue, and the decreased expression of only one gene, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family, member A2 (ALDH1a2), was also associated with shorter recurrence-free survival. ALDH1a2 encodes an enzyme responsible for synthesis of retinoic acid (RA), a compound with prodifferentiation properties. By immunohistochemistry, we observed that ALDH1a2 was expressed in epithelia from normal prostate but not prostate cancer. Using bisulfite sequencing, we determined that the ALDH1a2 promoter region was significantly hypermethylated in primary prostate tumors compared with normal prostate specimens (P = 0.01). Finally, transfection-mediated reexpression of wild-type ALDH1a2 (but not a presumptive catalytically dead mutant) in the prostate cancer cell line DU145 resulted in decreased colony growth (P < 0.0001), comparable with treatment with either 5-aza-dC or RA.

Raldh2-/- knockout embryos exhibit defective morphogenesis of various forebrain derivatives, including the ventral diencephalon, the optic and telencephalic vesicles. These defects are preceded by regionally decreased cell proliferation in the neuroepithelium, correlating with abnormally low D-cyclin gene expression. Increases in cell death also contribute to the morphological deficiencies at later stages. Molecular analyses reveal abnormally low levels of FGF signaling in the craniofacial region, and impaired sonic hedgehog signaling in the ventral diencephalon. Expression levels of several regulators of diencephalic, telencephalic and optic development therefore cannot be maintained. These results unveil crucial roles of RA during early mouse forebrain development, which may involve the regulation of the expansion of neural progenitor cells through a crosstalk with FGF and sonic hedgehog signaling pathways.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"22930583","pmcid":null,"title":"Astrocytes as a regulated source of retinoic acid for the brain.","authors":["Shearer KD","Fragoso YD","Clagett-Dame M","McCaffery PJ"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":["Wellcome Trust"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Glia","journalShort":"Glia","day":17,"month":12,"year":2012,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Astrocytes","Brain","Cells, Cultured","Humans","Male","Mice","Mice, Transgenic","Middle Aged","Rats","Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Retinal Dehydrogenase","Tretinoin","Vitamin A Deficiency"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (RALDH) catalyze the synthesis of the regulatory factor retinoic acid (RA). Cultured astrocytes express several of the RALDH enzyme family, and it has been assumed that this can be extrapolated to astrocytes in vivo. However, this study finds that few astrocytes in the rodent brain express detectable RALDH enzymes, and only when these cells are grown in culture are these enzymes upregulated. Factors controlling the expression of the RALDHs in cultured astrocytes were explored to determine possible reasons for differences between in vitro versus in vivo expression. Retinoids were found to feedback to suppress several of the RALDHs, and physiological levels of retinoids may be one route by which astrocytic RALDHs are maintained at low levels. In the case of RALDH2, in vivo reduction of vitamin A levels in rats resulted in an increase in astrocyte RALDH2 expression in the hippocampus. Other factors though are likely to control RALDH expression. A shift in astrocytic RALDH subcellular localization is a potential mechanism for regulating RA signaling. Under conditions of vitamin A deficiency, RALDH2 protein moved from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where it may synthesize RA at the site of the nuclear RA receptors. Similarly, in conditions of oxidative stress RALDH1 and RALDH2 moved from the cytoplasm to a predominantly nuclear position. Thus, the RALDHs have been revealed to be dynamic in their expression in astrocytes where they may maintain retinoid homeostasis in the brain.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"20450613","pmcid":null,"title":"[Effects of 5-Aza-2'-deoxycitydine and trichostatin A on expression and apoptosis of ALDH1a2 gene in human bladder cancer cell lines].","authors":["Ju ZH","Ying MG","Ai X","Shi TP","Wang BJ","Wang C","Zhang GX","Zhang X"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Zhonghua wai ke za zhi [Chinese journal of surgery]","journalShort":"Zhonghua Wai Ke Za Zhi","day":1,"month":3,"year":2010,"meshHeadings":["Apoptosis","Azacitidine","Cell Line, Tumor","Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic","Humans","Hydroxamic Acids","Retinal Dehydrogenase","Urinary Bladder Neoplasms"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To study the effect on promoter de-methylation, expression of ALDH1a2 gene and cell apoptosis by treated with 5-Aza-dC and TSA in five human bladder cancer cell lines.

Ubiquitin is a small protein modifier that is adducted to lysine residues by the combined function of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes and is removed by deubiquitinating enzymes. Characterization of ubiquitination sites is important for understanding the role of this modification in cellular processes and disease. However, until recently, large-scale characterization of endogenous ubiquitination sites has been hampered by the lack of efficient enrichment techniques. The introduction of antibodies that specifically recognize peptides with lysine residues that harbor a di-glycine remnant (K-ε-GG) following tryptic digestion has dramatically improved the ability to enrich and identify ubiquitination sites from cellular lysates. We used this enrichment technique to study the effects of proteasome inhibition by MG-132 and deubiquitinase inhibition by PR-619 on ubiquitination sites in human Jurkat cells by quantitative high performance mass spectrometry. Minimal fractionation of digested lysates prior to immunoaffinity enrichment increased the yield of K-ε-GG peptides three- to fourfold resulting in detection of up to ~3300 distinct K-GG peptides in SILAC triple encoded experiments starting from 5 mg of protein per label state. In total, we identify 5533 distinct K-ε-GG peptides of which 4907 were quantified in this study, demonstrating that the strategy presented is a practical approach to perturbational studies in cell systems. We found that proteasome inhibition by MG-132 and deubiquitinase inhibition by PR-619 induces significant changes to the ubiquitin landscape, but that not all ubiquitination sites regulated by MG-132 and PR-619 are likely substrates for the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Additionally, we find that the proteasome and deubiquitinase inhibitors studied induced only minor changes in protein expression levels regardless of the extent of regulation induced at the ubiquitin site level. We attribute this finding to the low stoichiometry of the majority ubiquitination sites identified in this study.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"19609347","pmcid":"2702100","title":"A genome-wide association study of hypertension and blood pressure in African Americans.","authors":["Adeyemo A","Gerry N","Chen G","Herbert A","Doumatey A","Huang H","Zhou J","Lashley K","Chen Y","Christman M","Rotimi C"],"grantIds":["2 M01 RR010284","S06 GM008016-320107","S06 GM008016-380111","Z01 HG200362"],"grantAgencies":["NCRR NIH HHS","NIGMS NIH HHS","NIGMS NIH HHS","NHGRI NIH HHS","Intramural NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"PLoS genetics","journalShort":"PLoS Genet.","day":17,"month":7,"year":2009,"meshHeadings":["African Americans","Antiporters","Blood Pressure","Cluster Analysis","Genome-Wide Association Study","Humans","Hypertension","Karyopherins","Neoplasm Proteins","Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide","Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear","United States"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"The evidence for the existence of genetic susceptibility variants for the common form of hypertension (\"essential hypertension\") remains weak and inconsistent.

However, proteome-wide analysis of endogenous ubiquitylation remains a challenging task, and almost always has relied on cells expressing affinity tagged ubiquitin. Here we combine single-step immunoenrichment of ubiquitylated peptides with peptide fractionation and high-resolution mass spectrometry to investigate endogenous ubiquitylation sites. We precisely map 11,054 endogenous putative ubiquitylation sites (diglycine-modified lysines) on 4,273 human proteins. The presented data set covers 67% of the known ubiquitylation sites and contains 10,254 novel sites on proteins with diverse cellular functions including cell signaling, receptor endocytosis, DNA replication, DNA damage repair, and cell cycle progression. Our method enables site-specific quantification of ubiquitylation in response to cellular perturbations and is applicable to any cell type or tissue. Global quantification of ubiquitylation in cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 discovers sites that are involved in proteasomal degradation, and suggests a nonproteasomal function for almost half of all sites. Surprisingly, ubiquitylation of about 15% of sites decreased more than twofold within four hours of MG-132 treatment, showing that inhibition of proteasomal function can dramatically reduce ubiquitylation on many sites with non-proteasomal functions. Comparison of ubiquitylation sites with acetylation sites reveals an extensive overlap between the lysine residues targeted by these two modifications. However, the crosstalk between these two post-translational modifications is significantly less frequent on sites that show increased ubiquitylation upon proteasome inhibition. Taken together, we report the largest site-specific ubiquitylation dataset in human cells, and for the first time demonstrate proteome-wide, site-specific quantification of endogenous putative ubiquitylation sites.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"19478994","pmcid":"2682703","title":"Consequences of lineage-specific gene loss on functional evolution of surviving paralogs: ALDH1A and retinoic acid signaling in vertebrate genomes.","authors":["Cañestro C","Catchen JM","Rodríguez-Marí A","Yokoi H","Postlethwait JH"],"grantIds":["R01 RR020833"],"grantAgencies":["NCRR NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"PLoS genetics","journalShort":"PLoS Genet.","day":29,"month":5,"year":2009,"meshHeadings":["Aldehyde Dehydrogenase","Animals","Evolution, Molecular","Fishes","Gene Deletion","Gene Duplication","Genome","Humans","Isoenzymes","Multigene Family","Phylogeny","Retinal Dehydrogenase","Signal Transduction","Tretinoin","Vertebrates"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Genome duplications increase genetic diversity and may facilitate the evolution of gene subfunctions. Little attention, however, has focused on the evolutionary impact of lineage-specific gene loss. Here, we show that identifying lineage-specific gene loss after genome duplication is important for understanding the evolution of gene subfunctions in surviving paralogs and for improving functional connectivity among human and model organism genomes. We examine the general principles of gene loss following duplication, coupled with expression analysis of the retinaldehyde dehydrogenase Aldh1a gene family during retinoic acid signaling in eye development as a case study. Humans have three ALDH1A genes, but teleosts have just one or two. We used comparative genomics and conserved syntenies to identify loss of ohnologs (paralogs derived from genome duplication) and to clarify uncertain phylogenies. Analysis showed that Aldh1a1 and Aldh1a2 form a clade that is sister to Aldh1a3-related genes. Genome comparisons showed secondarily loss of aldh1a1 in teleosts, revealing that Aldh1a1 is not a tetrapod innovation and that aldh1a3 was recently lost in medaka, making it the first known vertebrate with a single aldh1a gene. Interestingly, results revealed asymmetric distribution of surviving ohnologs between co-orthologous teleost chromosome segments, suggesting that local genome architecture can influence ohnolog survival. We propose a model that reconstructs the chromosomal history of the Aldh1a family in the ancestral vertebrate genome, coupled with the evolution of gene functions in surviving Aldh1a ohnologs after R1, R2, and R3 genome duplications. Results provide evidence for early subfunctionalization and late subfunction-partitioning and suggest a mechanistic model based on altered regulation leading to heterochronic gene expression to explain the acquisition or modification of subfunctions by surviving ohnologs that preserve unaltered ancestral developmental programs in the face of gene loss.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"24524833","pmcid":null,"title":"Levels of the retinoic acid synthesizing enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase-1A2 are lower in testicular tissue from men with infertility.","authors":["Amory JK","Arnold S","Lardone MC","Piottante A","Ebensperger M","Isoherranen N","Muller CH","Walsh T","Castro A"],"grantIds":["U54 HD042454","U54 HD42454"],"grantAgencies":["NICHD NIH HHS","NICHD NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Fertility and sterility","journalShort":"Fertil.

DESIGN: Observational analysis of testicular tissue samples, sperm indices, and serum hormone concentrations. SETTING: Two infertility centers in Chile. PATIENT(S): 32 infertile men and 11 control men. INTERVENTION(S): Measurement of the three enzymes necessary for retinoic acid biosynthesis, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) 1A1, 1A2, and 1A3, in testicular tissue by a novel liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) peptide assay. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): ALDH isozyme levels compared by type of infertility and correlated with testicular germ cell numbers, sperm parameters, and serum and intratesticular hormone concentrations. RESULT(S): Men with infertility had statistically significantly reduced levels of ALDH1A2 but not ALDH1A1 or ALDH1A3 in their testicular tissue compared with men with normal spermatogenesis. The ALDH1A2 protein levels were strongly correlated with the number of germ cells found via testicular biopsy. CONCLUSION(S): These findings suggest that ALDH1A2 is the enzyme involved in retinoic acid biosynthesis in human germ cells. Further study of the relationship between intratesticular ALDH1A2 and male infertility is warranted to determine whether men with infertility have a reduced ability to synthesize retinoic acid within their germ cells that could impair spermatogenesis.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"24728293","pmcid":null,"title":"Severe osteoarthritis of the hand associates with common variants within the ALDH1A2 gene and with rare variants at 1p31.","authors":["Styrkarsdottir U","Thorleifsson G","Helgadottir HT","Bomer N","Metrustry S","Bierma-Zeinstra S","Strijbosch AM","Evangelou E","Hart D","Beekman M","Jonasdottir A","Sigurdsson A","Eiriksson FF","Thorsteinsdottir M","Frigge ML","Kong A","Gudjonsson SA","Magnusson OT","Masson G","TREAT-OA Consortium","arcOGEN Consortium","Hofman A","Arden NK","Ingvarsson T","Lohmander S","Kloppenburg M","Rivadeneira F","Nelissen RG","Spector T","Uitterlinden A","Slagboom PE","Thorsteinsdottir U","Jonsdottir I","Valdes AM","Meulenbelt I","van Meurs J","Jonsson H","Stefansson K"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Nature genetics","journalShort":"Nat.

Our technology bypasses the need to overexpress tagged variants of ubiquitin and the use of sequence-biased antibodies recognizing ubiquitin remnants. In brief, all protein primary amino groups are blocked by chemical acetylation, after which ubiquitin chains are proteolytically and specifically removed by the catalytic core domain of the USP2 deubiquitinase (USP2cc). Because USP2cc cleaves the isopeptidyl bond between the ubiquitin C-terminus and the ε-amino group of the ubiquitinated lysine, this enzyme reintroduces primary ε-amino groups in proteins. These amino groups are then chemically modified with a handle that allows specific isolation of ubiquitinated peptides during subsequent COFRADIC chromatographic runs.

In a comparison of protein expression profiles, 2073 protein spots were found to be altered, and 15 proteins of them were remarkably altered. These proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. The most differently expressed proteins were aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A2 (ALDH1A2) and vimentin. Both proteins were verified using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. ALDH1A2 protein was found to be effective in AraC resistance. ALDH1A2 knock-down induced sensitivity to AraC treatment in K562AC cells, and ALDH1A2 overexpressed K562S cells acquired the AraC resistance. Furthermore, the findings also suggest that ALDH1A2 expression is increased after the appearance of AraC resistance in clinical cases.

However, the identity of the permissive cell types and the required steps of conversion of vitamin A to biologically active ATRA bringing about retinoic acid receptor-regulated signaling remains elusive. Here we present that only a subset of murine and human DCs express the necessary enzymes, including RDH10, RALDH2, and transporter cellular retinoic acid binding protein (CRABP)2, to produce ATRA and efficient signaling. These permissive cell types include CD103(+) DCs, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and interleukin-4-treated bone marrow-derived murine DCs and human monocyte-derived DCs (mo-DCs). Importantly, in addition to RDH10 and RALDH2, CRABP2 also appears to be regulated by the fatty acid-sensing nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and colocalize in human gut-associated lymphoid tissue DCs. In our model of human mo-DCs, all three proteins (RDH10, RALDH2, and CRABP2) appeared to be required for ATRA production induced by activation of PPARγ and therefore form a linear pathway. This now functionally validated PPARγ-regulated ATRA producing and signaling axis equips the cells with the capacity to convert precursors to active retinoids in response to receptor-activating fatty acids and is potentially amenable to intervention in diseases involving or affecting mucosal immunity.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"24121790","pmcid":"3840115","title":"A genome-wide association study identifies new susceptibility loci for esophageal adenocarcinoma and Barrett's esophagus.","authors":["Levine DM","Ek WE","Zhang R","Liu X","Onstad L","Sather C","Lao-Sirieix P","Gammon MD","Corley DA","Shaheen NJ","Bird NC","Hardie LJ","Murray LJ","Reid BJ","Chow WH","Risch HA","Nyrén O","Ye W","Liu G","Romero Y","Bernstein L","Wu AH","Casson AG","Chanock SJ","Harrington P","Caldas I","Debiram-Beecham I","Caldas C","Hayward NK","Pharoah PD","Fitzgerald RC","Macgregor S","Whiteman DC","Vaughan TL"],"grantIds":["076113","2P50CA093459","C490/A10119","C490/A10124","HHSN268200782096C","K05 CA124911","K05CA124911","MC_U105365007","NIDDK 02956","NIHR-RP-02-12-011","P01 CA091955","P30 CA016086","P30CA016672","R01 CA072866","R01 CA136725","R01 CA57947-03","R01CA100264","R01CA133996","R01CA136725","R01CA59636","R01DK63616","U01 CA057949","U01 CA057949-03","U01CA57923","U01CA57949","U01CA57983"],"grantAgencies":["Wellcome Trust","NCI NIH HHS","Cancer Research UK","Cancer Research UK","PHS HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","Medical Research Council","PHS HHS","Department of Health","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","Medical Research Council"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Nature genetics","journalShort":"Nat.
