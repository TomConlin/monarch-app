However, the in vivo role of BMP signaling during chondrogenesis has been unclear. We report here that BMP signaling is essential for multiple aspects of early chondrogenesis. Whereas mice deficient in type 1 receptors Bmpr1a or Bmpr1b in cartilage are able to form intact cartilaginous elements, double mutants develop a severe generalized chondrodysplasia. The majority of skeletal elements that form through endochondral ossification are absent, and the ones that form are rudimentary. The few cartilage condensations that form in double mutants are delayed in the prechondrocytic state and never form an organized growth plate. The reduced size of mutant condensations results from increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation. Moreover, the expression of cartilage-specific extracellular matrix proteins is severely reduced in mutant elements. We demonstrate that this defect in chondrocytic differentiation can be attributed to lack of Sox9, L-Sox5, and Sox6 expression in precartilaginous condensations in double mutants. In summary, our study demonstrates that BMPR1A and BMPR1B are functionally redundant during early chondrogenesis and that BMP signaling is required for chondrocyte proliferation, survival, and differentiation in vivo.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"15492776","pmcid":"523229","title":"BMP receptor signaling is required for postnatal maintenance of articular cartilage.","authors":["Rountree RB","Schoor M","Chen H","Marks ME","Harley V","Mishina Y","Kingsley DM"],"grantIds":["R37 AR042236"],"grantAgencies":["NIAMS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"PLoS biology","journalShort":"PLoS Biol.","day":19,"month":11,"year":2004,"meshHeadings":["Alleles","Animals","Apoptosis","Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors","Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors, Type I","Bone Morphogenetic Proteins","Cartilage","Cartilage, Articular","Cell Proliferation","Chromosomes, Artificial, Bacterial","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Genetic Variation","Growth Differentiation Factor 5","Inflammation","Integrases","Joints","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Mice, Transgenic","Molecular Sequence Data","Mutation","Osteoarthritis","Phenotype","Recombination, Genetic","Risk Factors","Signal Transduction","Synovial Membrane","Time Factors"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Articular cartilage plays an essential role in health and mobility, but is frequently damaged or lost in millions of people that develop arthritis. The molecular mechanisms that create and maintain this thin layer of cartilage that covers the surface of bones in joint regions are poorly understood, in part because tools to manipulate gene expression specifically in this tissue have not been available. Here we use regulatory information from the mouse Gdf5 gene (a bone morphogenetic protein [BMP] family member) to develop new mouse lines that can be used to either activate or inactivate genes specifically in developing joints. Expression of Cre recombinase from Gdf5 bacterial artificial chromosome clones leads to specific activation or inactivation of floxed target genes in developing joints, including early joint interzones, adult articular cartilage, and the joint capsule. We have used this system to test the role of BMP receptor signaling in joint development. Mice with null mutations in Bmpr1a are known to die early in embryogenesis with multiple defects. However, combining a floxed Bmpr1a allele with the Gdf5-Cre driver bypasses this embryonic lethality, and leads to birth and postnatal development of mice missing the Bmpr1a gene in articular regions. Most joints in the body form normally in the absence of Bmpr1a receptor function. However, articular cartilage within the joints gradually wears away in receptor-deficient mice after birth in a process resembling human osteoarthritis. Gdf5-Cre mice provide a general system that can be used to test the role of genes in articular regions. BMP receptor signaling is required not only for early development and creation of multiple tissues, but also for ongoing maintenance of articular cartilage after birth. Genetic variation in the strength of BMP receptor signaling may be an important risk factor in human osteoarthritis, and treatments that mimic or augment BMP receptor signaling should be investigated as a possible therapeutic strategy for maintaining the health of joint linings.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"16414041","pmcid":null,"title":"Evidence that autocrine signaling through Bmpr1a regulates the proliferation, survival and morphogenetic behavior of distal lung epithelial cells.","authors":["Eblaghie MC","Reedy M","Oliver T","Mishina Y","Hogan BL"],"grantIds":["AR14317","HL080517"],"grantAgencies":["NIAMS NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","Intramural NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Developmental biology","journalShort":"Dev.

To address the role of Bmp signaling in the epithelium, we have exploited the fact that Bmp receptor type Ia (Alk3) is expressed in the epithelium during branching morphogenesis. Deletion of Bmpr1a in the epithelium with an Sftpc-cre transgene leads to dramatic defects in lung development. There is reduced epithelial proliferation, extensive apoptosis, changes in cell morphology and extrusion of cells into the lumen. By E18.5, there are fewer Type II cells than normal, and the lung contains large fluid-filled spaces. If cell death is prevented by making embryos homozygous null for the proapoptotic gene, Bax, the epithelial cells that are rescued can apparently differentiate, but normal morphogenesis is not restored. To determine whether Bmps made by the epithelium can function in an autocrine manner, mesenchyme-free endoderm was cultured in Matrigel with Fgfs. Under these conditions, the mutant epithelium fails to undergo secondary budding. Abnormal development was also seen when Bmp4 was specifically deleted in the epithelium using the Sftpc-cre transgene.

In support of this model, we found that culturing Nog;Grem1 double-mutant embryos with dorsomorphin restores sclerotome, whereas Pax1 expression in smoothened (Smo) mutants is not rescued, suggesting that inhibition of BMP is insufficient to induce sclerotome in the absence of Hh signaling.

Morphological and molecular examination demonstrated that no mesoderm had formed in the mutant embryos. The growth characteristics of homozygous mutant blastocysts cultured in vitro were indistinguishable from those of controls; however, embryonic ectoderm (epiblast) cell proliferation was reduced in all homozygous mutants at E6.5 before morphological abnormalities had become prominent.

Their formation is induced by signaling molecules originating from the AV myocardium, including bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). Here, we hypothesized that BMP signaling plays an important role in the AV myocardium during the maturation of AV valves from the cushions. To test our hypothesis, we used a unique Cre/lox system to target the deletion of a floxed Alk3 allele, the type IA receptor for BMPs, to cardiac myocytes of the AV canal (AVC). Lineage analysis indicated that cardiac myocytes of the AVC contributed to the tricuspid mural and posterior leaflets, the mitral septal leaflet, and the atrial border of the annulus fibrosus. When Alk3 was deleted in these cells, defects were seen in the same leaflets, ie, the tricuspid mural leaflet and mitral septal leaflet were longer, the tricuspid posterior leaflet was displaced and adherent to the ventricular wall, and the annulus fibrosus was disrupted resulting in ventricular preexcitation. The defects seen in mice with AVC-targeted deletion of Alk3 provide strong support for a role of Alk3 in human congenital heart diseases, such as Ebstein's anomaly. In conclusion, our mouse model demonstrated critical roles for Alk3 signaling in the AV myocardium during the development of AV valves and the annulus fibrosus.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"18927151","pmcid":null,"title":"BMP signaling negatively regulates bone mass through sclerostin by inhibiting the canonical Wnt pathway.","authors":["Kamiya N","Ye L","Kobayashi T","Mochida Y","Yamauchi M","Kronenberg HM","Feng JQ","Mishina Y"],"grantIds":["ES071003-11","K22 DE016977","K22 DE016977-03","P01 DK056246","P01 DK056246-090001","P01 DK56246","R01 AR051587","R01 AR051587","R01 AR051587-04","R21 AR052824","R21 AR052824","R21 AR052824-02","Z01 ES071003-10"],"grantAgencies":["NIEHS NIH HHS","NIDCR NIH HHS","NIDCR NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","Intramural NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":27,"month":11,"year":2008,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Biological Markers","Bone Density","Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors, Type I","Bone Morphogenetic Proteins","Bone and Bones","Collagen Type I","Down-Regulation","Embryo, Mammalian","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Genetic Markers","Glycoproteins","Integrases","Mice","Mice, Transgenic","Organ Size","Organ Specificity","Osteoprotegerin","RANK Ligand","Signal Transduction","Wnt Proteins"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are known to induce ectopic bone. However, it is largely unknown how BMP signaling in osteoblasts directly regulates endogenous bone. This study investigated the mechanism by which BMP signaling through the type IA receptor (BMPR1A) regulates endogenous bone mass using an inducible Cre-loxP system. When BMPR1A in osteoblasts was conditionally disrupted during embryonic bone development, bone mass surprisingly was increased with upregulation of canonical Wnt signaling. Although levels of bone formation markers were modestly reduced, levels of resorption markers representing osteoclastogenesis were severely reduced, resulting in a net increase in bone mass. The reduction of osteoclastogenesis was primarily caused by Bmpr1a-deficiency in osteoblasts, at least through the RANKL-OPG pathway. Sclerostin (Sost) expression was downregulated by about 90% and SOST protein was undetectable in osteoblasts and osteocytes, whereas the Wnt signaling was upregulated. Treatment of Bmpr1a-deficient calvariae with sclerostin repressed the Wnt signaling and restored normal bone morphology. By gain of Smad-dependent BMPR1A signaling in mice, Sost expression was upregulated and osteoclastogenesis was increased. Finally, the Bmpr1a-deficient bone phenotype was rescued by enhancing BMPR1A signaling, with restoration of osteoclastogenesis. These findings demonstrate that BMPR1A signaling in osteoblasts restrain endogenous bone mass directly by upregulating osteoclastogenesis through the RANKL-OPG pathway, or indirectly by downregulating canonical Wnt signaling through sclerostin, a Wnt inhibitor and a bone mass mediator.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"15673568","pmcid":null,"title":"Distinct developmental programs require different levels of Bmp signaling during mouse retinal development.","authors":["Murali D","Yoshikawa S","Corrigan RR","Plas DJ","Crair MC","Oliver G","Lyons KM","Mishina Y","Furuta Y"],"grantIds":["CA16672","EY13128"],"grantAgencies":["NCI NIH HHS","NEI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":11,"month":3,"year":2005,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Body Patterning","Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors, Type I","Bone Morphogenetic Proteins","Cell Proliferation","Chromosome Mapping","Fibroblast Growth Factors","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Immunohistochemistry","In Situ Hybridization","Mice","Mice, Transgenic","Models, Biological","Models, Genetic","Mutation","Neurons","Optic Nerve","Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases","Receptors, Growth Factor","Retina","Signal Transduction","Transgenes"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"The Bmp family of secreted signaling molecules is implicated in multiple aspects of embryonic development.

Shortly after blastocyst implantation, the solid mass of ectoderm cells is converted by a process known as cavitation into a pseudostratified columnar epithelium surrounding a central cavity. We have previously used two cell lines, which form embryoid bodies that do (PSA1) or do not (S2) cavitate, as an in vitro model system for studying the mechanism of cavitation in the early embryo. We provided evidence that cavitation is the result of both programmed cell death and selective cell survival, and that the process depends on signals from visceral endoderm (Coucouvanis, E. and Martin, G. R. (1995) Cell 83, 279-287). Here we show that Bmp2 and Bmp4 are expressed in PSA1 embryoid bodies and embryos at the stages when visceral endoderm differentiation and cavitation are occurring, and that blocking BMP signaling via expression of a transgene encoding a dominant negative mutant form of BMP receptor IB inhibits expression of the visceral endoderm marker, Hnf4, and prevents cavitation in PSA1 embryoid bodies. Furthermore, we show that addition of BMP protein to cultures of S2 embryoid bodies induces expression of Hnf4 and other visceral endoderm markers and also cavitation. Taken together, these data indicate that BMP signaling is both capable of promoting, and required for differentiation of, visceral endoderm and cavitation of embryoid bodies. Based on these and other data, we propose a model for the role of BMP signaling during peri-implantation stages of mouse embryo development.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"8605036","pmcid":null,"title":"Vascular smooth muscle cells express multiple type I receptors for TGF-beta, activin, and bone morphogenetic proteins.","authors":["Agrotis A","Samuel M","Prapas G","Bobik A"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Biochemical and biophysical research communications","journalShort":"Biochem.

In wild-type mice, enhanced expression of the kinase-inactive form of BMPR-IB mediated by an adenovirus vector also inhibits eyelid opening.

BMP-4, but not EGF or TGF-alpha, accelerates opening of the eyelid explants isolated from K5-Noggin transgenic mice when cultured ex vivo.

In Bmp4(tm1) homozygous null mutant embryos, lens induction is absent, but the process can be rescued by exogenous BMP4 protein applied into the optic vesicle in explant cultures. This is associated with rescue of ectodermal expression of Sox2, an early lens placode marker. Substituting the optic vesicle in explant cultures with BMP4-carrying beads, however, does not lead to lens induction, indicating that other factors produced by the optic vesicle are involved. BMP4 appears to regulate expression of a putative downstream gene, Msx2, in the optic vesicle. No change in Pax6 expression is seen in Bmp4(tm1) mutant eyes, and Bmp4 expression appears unaffected in the eyes of homozygous Pax6(Sey-1Neu), suggesting that PAX6 and BMP4 function independently.

Binding assays are not possible with the isoform 125I-BMP-2 unless the positively charged N-terminal sequence is removed to create a modified BMP-2, 125I-DR-BMP-2. Cross-competition experiments reveal that BMP-2 and BMP-4 interact with the same binding sites. Affinity cross-linking assays show that both BMPs interact with cell surface proteins corresponding in size to the type I (57- to 62-kDa) and type II (75- to 82-kDa) receptor components for TGF-beta and activin. Using a PCR approach, we have cloned a cDNA from NIH 3T3 cells which encodes a novel member of the transmembrane serine/threonine kinase family most closely resembling the cloned type I receptors for TGF-beta and activin. Transient expression of this receptor in COS-7 cells leads to an increase in specific 125I-BMP-4 binding and the appearance of a major affinity-labeled product of approximately 64 kDa that can be labeled by either tracer. This receptor has been named BRK-1 in recognition of its ability to bind BMP-2 and BMP-4 and its receptor kinase structure. Although BRK-1 does not require cotransfection of a type II receptor in order to bind ligand in COS cells, complex formation between BRK-1 and the BMP type II receptor DAF-4 can be demonstrated when the two receptors are coexpressed, affinity labeled, and immunoprecipitated with antibodies to either receptor subunit. We conclude that BRK-1 is a putative BMP type I receptor capable of interacting with a known type II receptor for BMPs.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"8707881","pmcid":null,"title":"Analysis of the native murine bone morphogenetic protein serine threonine kinase type I receptor (ALK-3).","authors":["Wu X","Robinson CE","Fong HW","Gimble JM"],"grantIds":["CA50898"],"grantAgencies":["NCI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Journal of cellular physiology","journalShort":"J.

We have used a polyclonal antibody to examine the expression of the native murine ALK-3 protein in murine tissues and bone morphogenetic protein-responsive cell lines.

Two bone morphogenetic protein-responsive cell lines, BMS2 bone marrow stromal cells and C2C12 myoblasts, expressed the ALK-3 protein constitutively. Cell differentiation was accompanied by modest changes in ALK-3 protein levels. Immunoprecipitation of the ALK-3 protein cross linked to [125I] BMP-4 revealed two major receptor complexes of approximately 90 kDa and 170 kDa in size. Biotin surface-labeling experiments revealed that the 85 kDa ALK-3 protein was constitutively associated with a novel 140 kDa surface glycoprotein.

However, the integrity of the data and the pace at which novel sequences can be identified depends to a great extent on the cDNA libraries that are used. Because altogether, in a typical cell, the mRNAs of the prevalent and intermediate frequency classes comprise as much as 50-65% of the total mRNA mass, but represent no more than 1000-2000 different mRNAs, redundant identification of mRNAs of these two frequency classes is destined to become overwhelming relatively early in any such random gene discovery programs, thus seriously compromising their cost-effectiveness. With the goal of facilitating such efforts, previously we developed a method to construct directionally cloned normalized cDNA libraries and applied it to generate infant brain (INIB) and fetal liver/spleen (INFLS) libraries, from which a total of 45,192 and 86,088 expressed sequence tags, respectively, have been derived. While improving the representation of the longest cDNAs in our libraries, we developed three additional methods to normalize cDNA libraries and generated over 35 libraries, most of which have been contributed to our integrated Molecular Analysis of Genomes and Their Expression (IMAGE) Consortium and thus distributed widely and used for sequencing and mapping. In an attempt to facilitate the process of gene discovery further, we have also developed a subtractive hybridization approach designed specifically to eliminate (or reduce significantly the representation of) large pools of arrayed and (mostly) sequenced clones from normalized libraries yet to be (or just partly) surveyed. Here we present a detailed description and a comparative analysis of four methods that we developed and used to generate normalize cDNA libraries from human (15), mouse (3), rat (2), as well as the parasite Schistosoma mansoni (1).

We previously obtained six different type I receptors, termed activin receptor-like kinase-1 (ALK-1) to -6.

ALK-3 messenger RNA (mRNA) is ubiquitously expressed in various adult mouse tissues, whereas ALK-6 mRNA is only found in brain and lung. The distribution of ALK-3 and ALK-6 mRNA in the postimplantation mouse embryo [6.5-15.5 days postcoitum (pc)] was studied by in situ hybridization. ALK-3 was nearly ubiquitously expressed throughout these stages of development, but was notably absent in the liver. In contrast, ALK-6 showed a more restricted expression pattern. ALK-6 mRNA was absent in early postimplantation embryos, was detected first in 9.5 days pc embryos, and persisted until 15.5 days pc. In midgestation embryos, ALK-6 transcripts were detected in mesenchymal precartilage condensations, premuscle masses, blood vessels, central nervous system, parts of the developing ear and eye, and epithelium. The expression in sites of developing cartilage and bone supports the idea that ALK-3 and -6 are receptors for BMPs in vivo.

Sequences flanking the transgene insertion site were cloned, mapped to chromosome 3, and used to identify the brachydactyly gene as the type IB bone morphogenetic protein receptor, BmprIB (ALK6). Expression analyses in wild-type mice revealed two major classes of BmprIB transcripts. Rather than representing unique coding RNAs generated by alternative splicing of a single pro-mRNA transcribed from one promoter, the distinct isoforms reflect evolution of two BmprIB promoters: one located distally, driving expression in the developing limb skeleton, and one situated proximally, initiating transcription in neural epithelium. The distal promoter is deleted in the insertional mutant, resulting in a regulatory allele (BmprIB(Tg)) lacking cis-sequences necessary for limb BmprIB expression. Mutants fail to generate digit cartilage, indicating that BMPRIB is the physiologic transducer for the formation of digit cartilage from the skeletal blastema. Expansion of BmprIB expression into the limb through acquisition of these distal cis-regulatory sequences appears, therefore, to be an important genetic component driving morphological diversity in distal extremities. GDF5 is a BMP-related signal, which is also required for proper digit formation. Analyses incorporating both Gdf5 and BmprIB(Tg) alleles revealed that BMPRIB regulates chondrogenesis and segmentation through both GDF5-dependent and -independent processes, and that, reciprocally, GDF5 acts through both IB and other type I receptors. Together, these findings provide in vivo support for the concept of combinatorial BMP signaling, in which distinct outcomes result both from a single receptor being triggered by different ligands and from a single ligand binding to different receptors.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"10725249","pmcid":null,"title":"Large-scale cDNA analysis reveals phased gene expression patterns during preimplantation mouse development.","authors":["Ko MS","Kitchen JR","Wang X","Threat TA","Wang X","Hasegawa A","Sun T","Grahovac MJ","Kargul GJ","Lim MK","Cui Y","Sano Y","Tanaka T","Liang Y","Mason S","Paonessa PD","Sauls AD","DePalma GE","Sharara R","Rowe LB","Eppig J","Morrell C","Doi H"],"grantIds":["R01HD32243"],"grantAgencies":["NICHD NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":30,"month":4,"year":2000,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Chromosome Mapping","DNA, Complementary","Embryonic Development","Expressed Sequence Tags","Female","Gene Expression","Gene Library","Humans","Male","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Pregnancy"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Little is known about gene action in the preimplantation events that initiate mammalian development.

In males, one of the most common GU malformations associated with loss of Hoxa13 function is hypospadia, a condition defined by the poor growth and closure of the urethra and glans penis. By examining early signaling in the developing mouse genital tubercle, we show that Hoxa13 is essential for normal expression of Fgf8 and Bmp7 in the urethral plate epithelium. In Hoxa13(GFP)-mutant mice, hypospadias occur as a result of the combined loss of Fgf8 and Bmp7 expression in the urethral plate epithelium, as well as the ectopic expression of noggin (Nog) in the flanking mesenchyme. In vitro supplementation with Fgf8 restored proliferation in homozygous mutants to wild-type levels, suggesting that Fgf8 is sufficient to direct early proliferation of the developing genital tubercle. However, the closure defects of the distal urethra and glans can be attributed to a loss of apoptosis in the urethra, which is consistent with reduced Bmp7 expression in this region. Mice mutant for Hoxa13 also exhibit changes in androgen receptor expression, providing a developmental link between Hoxa13-associated hypospadias and those produced by antagonists to androgen signaling. Finally, a novel role for Hoxa13 in the vascularization of the glans penis is also identified.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"10512203","pmcid":null,"title":"Exchangeable gene trap using the Cre/mutated lox system.","authors":["Araki K","Imaizumi T","Sekimoto T","Yoshinobu K","Yoshimuta J","Akizuki M","Miura K","Araki M","Yamamura K"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)","journalShort":"Cell.

However, one shortcoming of gene trapping is the relative inability to induce subtle mutations. This problem can be overcome by introducing a knock-in system into the gene trap strategy. Here, we have constructed a new gene trap vector, pU-Hachi, employing the Cre-mutated lox system (Araki et al., 1997), in which a pair of mutant lox, lox71 and lox66, was used to promote targeted integrative reaction by Cre recombinase. The pU-Hachi carries splicing acceptor (SA)-lox71-internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-beta-geo-pA-loxP-pA-pUC. By using this vector, we can carry out random insertional mutagenesis as the first step, and then we can replace the beta-geo gene with any gene of interest through Cre-mediated integration. We have isolated 109 trap clones electroporated with pU-Hachi, and analyzed their integration patterns by Southern blotting to select those carrying a single copy of the trap vector. By use of some of these clones, we have succeeded in exchanging the reporter gene at high efficiency, ranging between 20-80%. This integration system is also quite useful for plasmid rescue to recover flanking genomic sequences, because a plasmid vector sequence can be introduced even when the pUC sequence of the trap vector is lost through integration into the genome. Thus, this method, termed exchangeable gene trapping, has many advantages as the trapped clones can be utilized to express genes with any type of mutation.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"10349636","pmcid":null,"title":"High-efficiency full-length cDNA cloning.","authors":["Carninci P","Hayashizaki Y"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Methods in enzymology","journalShort":"Meth.

Their intracellular signals are propagated via respective type I receptors. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2, a member of the TGF-beta superfamily, induces ectopic bone formation when implanted into muscular tissues. Two type I receptors (BMPR-IA and BMPR-IB) have been identified for BMP-2. We have reported that BMP-2 inhibits the terminal differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts and converts their differentiation pathway into that of osteoblast lineage cells (Katagiri, T., Yamaguchi, A., Komaki, M., Abe, E., Takahashi, N., Ikeda, T., Rosen, V., Wozney, J. M., Fujisawa-Sehara, A. and Suda, T. (1994) J. Cell Biol. 127, 1755-1766). In the present study, we examined the involvement of functional BMP-2 type I receptors in signal transduction in C2C12 cells, which expressed mRNA for BMPR-IA, but not for BMPR-IB in Northern blotting. TGF-beta type I receptor (TbetaR-I) mRNA was also expressed in C2C12 cells. Subclonal cell lines of C2C12 that stably expressed a kinase domain-truncated BMPR-IA (DeltaBMPR-IA) differentiated into myosin heavy chain-expressing myotubes but not into alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-positive cells, even in the presence of BMP-2. In contrast, the differentiation of the DeltaBMPR-IA-transfected C2C12 cells into myotubes was suppressed by TGF-beta1, as in the parental C2C12 cells. BMP-2 did not efficiently suppress the mRNA expression of muscle-specific genes such as muscle creatine kinase, MyoD, and myogenin, nor did it induce the expression of ALP mRNA in the DeltaBMPR-IA-transfected C2C12 cells. In contrast, TGF-beta1 inhibited mRNA expression of the muscle-specific genes in those cells. When wild-type BMPR-IA was transiently transfected into the DeltaBMPR-IA-transfected C2C12 cells, a number of ALP-positive cells appeared in the presence of BMP-2. Transfection of wild-type BMPR-IB or TbetaR-I failed to increase the number of ALP-positive cells. These results suggest that the BMP-2-induced signals, which inhibit myogenic differentiation and induce osteoblast differentiation, are transduced via BMPR-IA in C2C12 myoblasts.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"9207184","pmcid":null,"title":"cDNA cloning and genomic organization of the mouse BMP type II receptor.","authors":["Beppu H","Minowa O","Miyazono K","Kawabata M"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Biochemical and biophysical research communications","journalShort":"Biochem.

Among 289 more highly expressed in placenta, 61 placenta-specific genes encoded, for example, a novel prolactin-like protein.

Bmp4 heterozygous null mutant mice display, with high penetrance, abnormalities that mimic human congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), including hypo/dysplastic kidneys, hydroureter, ectopic ureterovesical (UV) junction, and double collecting system. Analysis of mutant embryos suggests that the kidney hypo/dysplasia results from reduced branching of the ureter, whereas the ectopic UV junction and double collecting system are due to ectopic ureteral budding from the WD and accessory budding from the main ureter, respectively. In the cultured metanephros deprived of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (S-GAGs), BMP4-loaded beads partially rescue growth and elongation of the ureter. By contrast, when S-GAGs synthesis is not inhibited, BMP4 beads inhibit ureter branching and expression of Wnt 11, a target of glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor signaling. Thus, Bmp4 has 2 functions in the early morphogenesis of the kidney and urinary tract. One is to inhibit ectopic budding from the WD or the ureter stalk by antagonizing inductive signals from the metanephric mesenchyme to the illegitimate sites on the WD. The other is to promote the elongation of the branching ureter within the metanephros, thereby promoting kidney morphogenesis.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"11401393","pmcid":null,"title":"Mesenchymal factor bone morphogenetic protein 4 restricts ductal budding and branching morphogenesis in the developing prostate.","authors":["Lamm ML","Podlasek CA","Barnett DH","Lee J","Clemens JQ","Hebner CM","Bushman W"],"grantIds":["DK 02426","DK 52687","P01 ES10549"],"grantAgencies":["NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIEHS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Developmental biology","journalShort":"Dev.

The Bmp4 gene was most highly expressed in the male urogenital sinus from embryonic day 14 through birth, a period marked by formation of main prostatic ducts and initiation of ductal branching. From an initial wide distribution throughout the prostatic anlage of the urogenital sinus, Bmp4 expression became progressively restricted to the mesenchyme immediately surrounding the nascent prostatic ducts and branches. Exogenous BMP4 inhibited epithelial cell proliferation and exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of ductal budding in urogenital sinus tissues cultured in vitro.

To determine the mechanisms underlying BMP actions, we analyzed the expression and function of two BMP receptors, BMPR-IA and BMPR-IB, in neural precursor cells in vitro and in vivo. Neural precursor cells always express Bmpr-1a, but Bmpr-1b is not expressed until embryonic day 9 and is restricted to the dorsal neural tube surrounding the source of BMP ligands. BMPR-IA activation induces (and Sonic hedgehog prevents) expression of Bmpr-1b along with dorsal identity genes in precursor cells and promotes their proliferation. When BMPR-IB is activated, it limits precursor cell numbers by causing mitotic arrest. This results in apoptosis in early gestation embryos and terminal differentiation in mid-gestation embryos. Thus, BMP actions are first inducing (through BMPR-IA) and then terminating (through BMPR-IB), based on the accumulation of BMPR-IB relative to BMPR-IA.

METHODS: Indentation stiffness of the humerus head articular cartilage was measured by a microindentation method. Cartilage and subchondral bone were prepared for digital densitometry of proteoglycans (PGs), polarised light microscopy (PLM) of collagen, and osteoarthrosis (OA) grading. RESULTS: Heterozygous inactivation of the Col2a1 gene softened articular cartilage (p=0.002) as measured by indentation stiffness ((mean (SEM) 0.50 (0.07) MPa v 0.94 (0.13) MPa in controls). Fibrillar collagen network exhibited lower birefringence in the intermediate (p=0.04) and deep zones (p=0.01) of cartilage by PLM, indicating either decreased collagen content or a lower degree of fibril parallelism in the knockout mice. The total and zonal thicknesses of articular cartilage were unchanged. Zonal PG contents did not differ significantly. In knockout mice, the prevalence of superficial fibrillation-that is, a sign of OA, was higher than in controls (73% v 21%, p=0.002). The collagen induced birefringence of the superficial zone was not reduced. The subchondral bone volume fraction was lower in knockout mice than in controls, 31% v 43% (p=0.01), and optical retardation values in PLM of bone collagen were slightly but significantly lower (p=0.01).

Our study was conducted using (NZW x PL/J)F(1) x NZB (BWP) mice to determine the effects of the PL/J and the NZW genome on disease. Forty-five percent of BWP female mice had significant proteinuria and 25% died before 12 mo of age compared with (NZB x NZW)F(1) mice in which >90% developed severe renal disease and died before 12 mo. The analysis of BWP mice revealed a novel locus (chi(2) = 25.0; p < 1 x 10(-6); log of likelihood = 6.6 for mortality) designated Wbw1 on chromosome 2, which apparently plays an important role in the development of the disease. We also observed that both H-2 class II (the u haplotype) and TNF-alpha (TNF(z) allele) appear to contribute to the disease. A suggestive linkage to proteinuria and death was found for an NZW allele (designated Wbw2) telomeric to the H-2 locus. The NZW allele that overlaps with the previously described locus Sle1c at the telomeric part of chromosome 1 was associated with antinuclear autoantibody production in the present study. Furthermore, the previously identified Sle and Lbw susceptibility loci were associated with an increased incidence of disease.

Stereology and histology were used to analyse kidneys from mice heterozygous for mutations in either BMP2, BMPR-IA or ActR-IA. Roles of BMPs 2 and 4 in mouse metanephric development in vitro were analysed by culturing whole metanephroi in the presence of BMP2, BMP4, the BMP inhibitor noggin, and BMP4 plus noggin. Ureteric branching morphogenesis and nephrogenesis were analysed. By qualitative histology, kidneys from BMP2, BMPR-IA and ActR-IA heterozygous null mutant mice were found to be the same as those from wild type mice. The kidneys of the heterozygous mice contained the normal complement of nephrons. In vitro, high concentrations of BMP4 inhibited branching of the ureteric epithelium and changed its morphology, while nephrogenesis was inhibited by 50%. A range of concentrations of BMP2 did not alter ureteric or mesenchyme morphology, or the number of glomeruli formed. Noggin did not alter metanephric development in vitro, but did block the effect of BMP4.

Smad1 homozygous mutant embryos (Smad1-/-) were generated by in-frame insertion of lacZ gene into an exon of the Smad1 gene. Most of the Smad1-/- embryos contained no primordial germ cells (PGCs) and had short allantois, while histological analysis and in situ hybridization for the mesoderm marker genes revealed that early mesoderm induction was normal in those embryos. Smad1 expression was observed in epiblast and in visceral endoderm during gastrulation, while only a few alkaline phosphatase-positive PGCs at 7.5 and 8.5 days post coitum (E7.5 and E8.5) expressed Smad1. Phosphorylated SMAD proteins were localized in the proximal region of epiblast at E6.0-6.5, where the progenitors of PGCs and of allantois reside. Single-cell reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the expression of Smad1, -5 and -8 were sporadic and mutually independent in proximal epiblast cells. We also found that BMP4-induced differentiation of PGCs from epiblast in vitro was fully dependent on the existence of phosphorylated SMAD1.

On the basis of the asymmetry in the dorsal-ventral expression patterns of several members of this family, it has been proposed that these molecules are critical for some aspect of dorsal-ventral patterning in the eye; however, it has been difficult to test this hypothesis because of the early requirement for BMPs in eye development. We have therefore examined the effects of loss of one of the BMP receptors, the BmprIb, on the development of the eye by using targeted deletion. We have found that BmprIb is expressed exclusively in the ventral retina during embryonic development and is required for normal ventral ganglion cell axon targeting to the optic nerve head. In mice with a targeted deletion of the BmprIb gene, many axons arising from the ventrally located ganglion cells fail to enter the optic nerve head, and instead, make abrupt turns in this region. A second phenotype in these mice is a significantly elevated inner retinal apoptosis during a distinct phase of postnatal development, at the end of neurogenesis.

The results suggest that positive and negative feedback mechanisms modulate ectopic osteogenesis induced by this growth factor. INTRODUCTION: The expression of bone morphogenetic protein receptors (BMPRs) and Noggin during ectopic bone formation after implantation of BMP-2 into the back muscles of adult mice was investigated in this study. METHODS: One hundred ninety-eight male ddy mice were divided into groups and received either collagen disks containing BMP-2, collagen disks alone, or sham surgery with no disk implantation. Changes in the temporal and spatial expression profiles of BMPRs and Noggin were examined by Northern blotting, in situ hybridization, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: In the BMP group, expression of BMPR-1A, -2, and Noggin mRNA and protein was enhanced 2-4 days after implantation in undifferentiated mesenchymal cells and regenerating muscle fibers located close to the BMP-retaining implants. On day 7, the expression was also observed in cartilage cells, and after day 14, in the osteoblastic cells around bone tissue. The level of expression peaked at day 4 after implantation and persisted at a much lower level during the bone forming process. No significant expression of BMPR-1B was detected at the mRNA and protein levels during the bone-forming reaction. In the BMP free control groups, a mild enhancement of BMPR-2 expression was also noted around the implant, but this was not observed for BMPR-1A, -1B, or Noggin. Upregulated expression of BMPR-1A, -2, and Noggin in undifferentiated mesenchymal cells and regenerating muscle fibers occurs during the early phase of BMP-2-induced bone formation. The coordinate expression of these positive and negative regulators of BMP signaling points to a potential regulatory mechanism for bone induction.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"14610273","pmcid":null,"title":"Wnk1 kinase deficiency lowers blood pressure in mice: a gene-trap screen to identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention.","authors":["Zambrowicz BP","Abuin A","Ramirez-Solis R","Richter LJ","Piggott J","BeltrandelRio H","Buxton EC","Edwards J","Finch RA","Friddle CJ","Gupta A","Hansen G","Hu Y","Huang W","Jaing C","Key BW","Kipp P","Kohlhauff B","Ma ZQ","Markesich D","Payne R","Potter DG","Qian N","Shaw J","Schrick J","Shi ZZ","Sparks MJ","Van Sligtenhorst I","Vogel P","Walke W","Xu N","Zhu Q","Person C","Sands AT"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","journalShort":"Proc.

As part of this screen, mice deficient for the Wnk1 kinase gene were generated and analyzed. Genetic studies in humans have shown that large intronic deletions in WNK1 lead to its overexpression and are responsible for pseudohypoaldosteronism type II, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by hypertension, increased renal salt reabsorption, and impaired K+ and H+ excretion. Consistent with the human genetic studies, Wnk1 heterozygous mice displayed a significant decrease in blood pressure.

The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signal has an essential role in inducing haematopoietic tissue during embryogenesis. We investigated the roles of the BMP signalling pathway in regulating adult HSC development in vivo by analysing mutant mice with conditional inactivation of BMP receptor type IA (BMPRIA). Here we show that an increase in the number of spindle-shaped N-cadherin+CD45- osteoblastic (SNO) cells correlates with an increase in the number of HSCs. The long-term HSCs are found attached to SNO cells. Two adherens junction molecules, N-cadherin and beta-catenin, are asymmetrically localized between the SNO cells and the long-term HSCs.

Smad4-deficient metanephric mesenchyme does not display defects in inducibility in LiCl or spinal cord induction assays. However, in situ hybridization and lineage analysis of Smad4 null mesenchyme cells at E11.5 show that the nephrogenic mesenchyme does not aggregate tightly around the ureteric bud tips, but remains loosely associated, embedded within a population of cells expressing markers of both nephrogenic mesenchyme and peripheral stroma. We conclude that the failure of recruitment of nephrogenic mesenchyme leaves a primitive population of mesenchyme at the periphery of the kidney. This population is gradually depleted, and by E16.5 the periphery is composed of cells of stromal phenotype. This study uncovers a novel role for TGFbeta superfamily signaling in the recruitment and/or organization of the nephrogenic mesenchyme at early time-points of kidney development. Additionally, we present conclusive genetic lineage mapping of the collecting duct and nephrogenic mesenchyme.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"15136139","pmcid":null,"title":"A Titin mutation defines roles for circulation in endothelial morphogenesis.","authors":["May SR","Stewart NJ","Chang W","Peterson AS"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Developmental biology","journalShort":"Dev.

We have generated a double knockout of both BMP type 1 receptors, Bmpr1a and Bmpr1b, in the neural tube. These double knockout mice demonstrate a complete loss of D1 progenitor cells, as evidenced by loss of Math1 expression, and the subsequent failure to form differentiated DI1 interneurons. Furthermore, the DI2 interneuron population is profoundly reduced. The loss of these populations of cells results in a dorsal shift of the dorsal cell populations, DI3 and DI4. Other dorsal interneuron populations, DI5 and DI6, and ventral neurons appear unaffected by the loss of BMP signaling. The Bmpr double knockout animals demonstrate a reduction in the expression of Wnt and Id family members, suggesting that BMP signaling regulates expression of these factors in spinal cord development.

This study tests the role of the BMP type I receptor ACVRI in establishing left-right asymmetry in chimeric mouse embryos. Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells with a homozygous deletion at Acvr1 were used to generate chimeric embryos. Chimeric embryos were rescued from the gastrulation defect of Acvr1 null embryos but exhibited abnormal heart looping and embryonic turning. High mutant contribution chimeras expressed left-side markers such as nodal bilaterally in the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM), indicating that loss of ACVRI signaling leads to left isomerism. Expression of lefty1 was absent in the midline of chimeric embryos, but shh, a midline marker, was expressed normally, suggesting that, despite formation of midline, its barrier function was abolished. High-contribution chimeras also lacked asymmetric expression of nodal in the node. These data suggest that ACVRI signaling negatively regulates left-side determinants such as nodal and positively regulates lefty1. These functions maintain the midline, restrict expression of left-side markers, and are required for left-right pattern formation during embryogenesis in the mouse.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"15289457","pmcid":null,"title":"BMP signaling mediated by ALK2 in the visceral endoderm is necessary for the generation of primordial germ cells in the mouse embryo.","authors":["de Sousa Lopes SM","Roelen BA","Monteiro RM","Emmens R","Lin HY","Li E","Lawson KA","Mummery CL"],"grantIds":["DK-19406","DK-D02716","R01 HD35286"],"grantAgencies":["NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NICHD NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Genes & development","journalShort":"Genes Dev.","day":1,"month":8,"year":2004,"meshHeadings":["Activin Receptors, Type I","Adenoviridae","Animals","Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4","Bone Morphogenetic Proteins","Embryo, Mammalian","Endoderm","Fibronectins","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Germ Cells","Heterozygote","Humans","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Mice, Knockout","Mice, Mutant Strains","Proteins","Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction","Signal Transduction","Tumor Cells, Cultured"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Deletion of various bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and their downstream Smads in mice have clearly shown that BMP signaling is essential for the formation of primordial germ cells (PGCs).

Firstly, embryonic day 5.5-6.0 (E5.5-E6.0) embryos cultured on fibronectin formed PGCs in the presence of VE, but not in its absence.

This paper summarizes some of the functions of these ligands in lens development. Targeted deletion of the genes encoding one of the BMP receptors, Alk3 (BMP receptor-1A), showed that signaling through this receptor is essential for normal lens development. Lenses lacking Alk3 were smaller than normal, with thin epithelial layers. The fiber cells of Alk3 null lenses became vacuolated and degenerated within the first week after birth. Lenses lacking Alk3 function were surrounded by abnormal mesenchymal cells, suggesting that the lenses provided inappropriate signals to surrounding tissues. Lens epithelial and fiber cells contained endosomes that were associated with activated (phosphorylated) SMAD1 and SMAD2. Endosomal localization of pSMAD1 was reduced in the absence of Alk3 signaling. The presence of pSMAD2 in lens fiber cell nuclei and the observation that the activin antagonist follistatin inhibited lens cell elongation suggested that an activin-like molecule participates in lens fiber cell differentiation. Lenses deficient in type II TGFbeta receptors were clear and had fiber cells of normal morphology. This suggests that TGFbeta signaling is not essential for the normal differentiation of lens fiber cells. The targeted deletion of single or multiple receptors of the TGFbeta superfamily in the lens should further characterize the role of these signaling molecules in lens development. This approach may also provide a useful way to define the downstream pathways that are activated by these receptors during the development of the lens and other tissues.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"16141072","pmcid":null,"title":"The transcriptional landscape of the mammalian genome.","authors":["Carninci P","Kasukawa T","Katayama S","Gough J","Frith MC","Maeda N","Oyama R","Ravasi T","Lenhard B","Wells C","Kodzius R","Shimokawa K","Bajic VB","Brenner SE","Batalov S","Forrest AR","Zavolan M","Davis MJ","Wilming LG","Aidinis V","Allen JE","Ambesi-Impiombato A","Apweiler R","Aturaliya RN","Bailey TL","Bansal M","Baxter L","Beisel KW","Bersano T","Bono H","Chalk AM","Chiu KP","Choudhary V","Christoffels A","Clutterbuck DR","Crowe ML","Dalla E","Dalrymple BP","de Bono B","Della Gatta G","di Bernardo D","Down T","Engstrom P","Fagiolini M","Faulkner G","Fletcher CF","Fukushima T","Furuno M","Futaki S","Gariboldi M","Georgii-Hemming P","Gingeras TR","Gojobori T","Green RE","Gustincich S","Harbers M","Hayashi Y","Hensch TK","Hirokawa N","Hill D","Huminiecki L","Iacono M","Ikeo K","Iwama A","Ishikawa T","Jakt M","Kanapin A","Katoh M","Kawasawa Y","Kelso J","Kitamura H","Kitano H","Kollias G","Krishnan SP","Kruger A","Kummerfeld SK","Kurochkin IV","Lareau LF","Lazarevic D","Lipovich L","Liu J","Liuni S","McWilliam S","Madan Babu M","Madera M","Marchionni L","Matsuda H","Matsuzawa S","Miki H","Mignone F","Miyake S","Morris K","Mottagui-Tabar S","Mulder N","Nakano N","Nakauchi H","Ng P","Nilsson R","Nishiguchi S","Nishikawa S","Nori F","Ohara O","Okazaki Y","Orlando V","Pang KC","Pavan WJ","Pavesi G","Pesole G","Petrovsky N","Piazza S","Reed J","Reid JF","Ring BZ","Ringwald M","Rost B","Ruan Y","Salzberg SL","Sandelin A","Schneider C","Schönbach C","Sekiguchi K","Semple CA","Seno S","Sessa L","Sheng Y","Shibata Y","Shimada H","Shimada K","Silva D","Sinclair B","Sperling S","Stupka E","Sugiura K","Sultana R","Takenaka Y","Taki K","Tammoja K","Tan SL","Tang S","Taylor MS","Tegner J","Teichmann SA","Ueda HR","van Nimwegen E","Verardo R","Wei CL","Yagi K","Yamanishi H","Zabarovsky E","Zhu S","Zimmer A","Hide W","Bult C","Grimmond SM","Teasdale RD","Liu ET","Brusic V","Quackenbush J","Wahlestedt C","Mattick JS","Hume DA","Kai C","Sasaki D","Tomaru Y","Fukuda S","Kanamori-Katayama M","Suzuki M","Aoki J","Arakawa T","Iida J","Imamura K","Itoh M","Kato T","Kawaji H","Kawagashira N","Kawashima T","Kojima M","Kondo S","Konno H","Nakano K","Ninomiya N","Nishio T","Okada M","Plessy C","Shibata K","Shiraki T","Suzuki S","Tagami M","Waki K","Watahiki A","Okamura-Oho Y","Suzuki H","Kawai J","Hayashizaki Y","FANTOM Consortium","RIKEN Genome Exploration Research Group and Genome Science Group (Genome Network Project Core Group)"],"grantIds":["TGM03P17","TGM06S01"],"grantAgencies":["Telethon","Telethon"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","journalShort":"Science","day":2,"month":9,"year":2005,"meshHeadings":["3' Untranslated Regions","Animals","Base Sequence","Conserved Sequence","DNA, Complementary","Genome","Genome, Human","Genomics","Humans","Mice","Promoter Regions, Genetic","Proteins","RNA","RNA Splicing","RNA, Untranslated","Regulatory Sequences, Ribonucleic Acid","Terminator Regions, Genetic","Transcription Initiation Site","Transcription, Genetic"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"This study describes comprehensive polling of transcription start and termination sites and analysis of previously unidentified full-length complementary DNAs derived from the mouse genome.

Here, we inactivated bone morphogenetic protein 2 (Bmp2) in the AV myocardium of mice. We show that Bmp2 has three functions in the AV canal: to enhance formation of the cardiac jelly, to induce endocardial EMT and to pattern the AV myocardium. Bmp2 is required for myocardial expression of Has2, a crucial component of the cardiac jelly matrix. During EMT, Bmp2 promotes expression of the basic helix-loop-helix factor Twist1, previously implicated in EMT in cancer metastases, and the homeobox genes Msx1 and Msx2. Deletion of the Bmp type 1A receptor, Bmpr1a, in endocardium also resulted in failed cushion formation, indicating that Bmp2 signals directly to cushion-forming endocardium to induce EMT.

We expressed the mutant proteins in limb bud micromass culture and treated ATDC5 and C2C12 cells with recombinant GDF5. Our results indicated that the L441P mutant is almost inactive.

Although select TGFbeta/BMP/GDF proteins were found to interact with type II and type I serine/threonine receptors to activate downstream Smad and other proteins, the receptors and signaling pathways for one-third of these TGFbeta/BMP/GDF paralogs are still unclear. Based on a genomic analysis of the entire repertoire of TGFbeta/BMP/GDF ligands and serine/threonine kinase receptors, we tested the ability of three orphan BMP/GDF ligands to activate a limited number of phylogenetically related receptors. We characterized the dimeric nature of recombinant GDF6 (also known as BMP13), GDF7 (also known as BMP12), and BMP10. We demonstrated their bioactivities based on the activation of Smad1/5/8-, but not Smad2/3-, responsive promoter constructs in the MC3T3 cell line. Furthermore, we showed their ability to induce the phosphorylation of Smad1, but not Smad2, in these cells. In COS7 cells transfected with the seven known type I receptors, overexpression of ALK3 or ALK6 conferred ligand signaling by GDF6, GDF7, and BMP10. In contrast, transfection of MC3T3 cells with ALK3 small hairpin RNA suppressed Smad signaling induced by all three ligands. Based on the coevolution of ligands and receptors, we also tested the role of BMPRII and ActRIIA as the type II receptor candidates for the three orphan ligands. We found that transfection of small hairpin RNA for BMPRII and ActRIIA in MC3T3 cells suppressed the signaling of GDF6, GDF7, and BMP10.

Here, we examined mice with targeted mutations in the BMP type I receptor genes Bmpr1a and Bmpr1b, to genetically test the hypothesis that BMPs play an inductive role in the embryogenesis of cerebellar granule cells. In Bmpr1a;Bmpr1b double knock-out mice, severe cerebellar patterning defects are observed resulting in smaller cerebella that are devoid of foliation. In mutants containing either single BMP receptor gene mutation alone, cerebellar histogenesis appears normal, thereby demonstrating functional redundancy of type I BMP receptors during cerebellar development. Loss of BMP signaling in double mutant animals leads to a dramatic reduction in the number of cerebellar granule cells and ectopic location of many of those that remain. Molecular markers of granule cell specification, including Math1 and Zic1, are drastically downregulated. In addition, Purkinje cells are disorganized and ectopically located, but they appear to be correctly specified. Consistent with the interpretation that granule cells alone are affected, phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 is immunolocalized predominantly to granule cell precursors and not appreciably detected in Purkinje cell precursors.

Recent work has shed light on signaling pathways leading to the patterning and formation of the mammary placodes and buds in mouse embryos. Relatively little is known of the signaling pathways that initiate branching morphogenesis and the formation of the ducts from the embryonic buds. Previous studies have shown that parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP; also known as parathyroid hormone-like peptide, Pthlh) is produced by mammary epithelial cells and acts on surrounding mesenchymal cells to promote their differentiation into a mammary-specific dense mesenchyme. As a result of PTHrP signaling, the mammary mesenchyme supports mammary epithelial cell fate, initiates ductal development and patterns the overlying nipple sheath. In this report, we demonstrate that PTHrP acts, in part, by sensitizing mesenchymal cells to BMP signaling. PTHrP upregulates BMP receptor 1A expression in the mammary mesenchyme, enabling it to respond to BMP4, which is expressed within mesenchymal cells underlying the ventral epidermis during mammary bud formation. We demonstrate that BMP signaling is important for outgrowth of normal mammary buds and that BMP4 can rescue outgrowth of PTHrP(-/-) mammary buds. In addition, the combination of PTHrP and BMP signaling is responsible for upregulating Msx2 gene expression within the mammary mesenchyme, and disruption of the Msx2 gene rescues the induction of hair follicles on the ventral surface of mice overexpressing PTHrP in keratinocytes (K14-PTHrP). Our data suggest that PTHrP signaling sensitizes the mammary mesenchyme to the actions of BMP4, triggering outgrowth of the mammary buds and inducing MSX2 expression, which, in turn, leads to lateral inhibition of hair follicle formation within the developing nipple sheath.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"16809539","pmcid":null,"title":"Lhx2 maintains stem cell character in hair follicles.","authors":["Rhee H","Polak L","Fuchs E"],"grantIds":["R01 AR031737","R01 AR031737-24","R01 AR050452","R01 AR050452-04","R01-AR050452"],"grantAgencies":["NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","journalShort":"Science","day":30,"month":6,"year":2006,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Cell Differentiation","Cell Lineage","Cell Proliferation","Epidermis","Female","Gene Expression Profiling","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Hair","Hair Follicle","Homeodomain Proteins","LIM-Homeodomain Proteins","Male","Mice","Mice, Knockout","Mice, Transgenic","Morphogenesis","Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis","Signal Transduction","Skin Transplantation","Stem Cells","Transcription Factors","Up-Regulation"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"During embryogenesis, stem cells are set aside to fuel the postnatal hair cycle and repair the epidermis after injury.

Here, we show that BMP-2 increases the expression of Id-1 in differentiated podocytes. To investigate a role of Id-1 for podocyte function, overexpression of Id-1 was induced in differentiated mouse podocytes. Id-1-overexpressing podocytes show an increased NADPH-dependent production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This effect can be evoked by BMP-2 and can be antagonized by anti-Id-1 antisense oligonucleotides. The data indicate that BMP-2 may, via an increased expression of Id-1 and an increased generation of ROS, contribute to important cellular functions in podocytes. ROS supposedly play a major role in cell adhesion, cell injury, ion transport, fibrogenesis, angiogenesis and are involved in the pathogenesis of membranous nephropathy.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"17065231","pmcid":null,"title":"BMPs regulate multiple aspects of growth-plate chondrogenesis through opposing actions on FGF pathways.","authors":["Yoon BS","Pogue R","Ovchinnikov DA","Yoshii I","Mishina Y","Behringer RR","Lyons KM"],"grantIds":["R01 AR044528"],"grantAgencies":["NIAMS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":8,"month":12,"year":2006,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Apoptosis","Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors, Type I","Bone Morphogenetic Proteins","Cell Proliferation","Chondrogenesis","Female","Fibroblast Growth Factors","Growth Plate","Hedgehog Proteins","Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins","Male","Mice","Mice, Knockout","Mice, Mutant Strains","Mutation","Osteochondrodysplasias","Phenotype","Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1","Signal Transduction"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways are essential regulators of chondrogenesis.

Axons of neurons in the spinal cord lateral motor column (LMC), as defined by a transcription factor code, are thought to innervate limb target tissues exclusively. Axons of the medial and lateral LMC divisions appear to execute a binary decision at the base of the limb as they choose between ventral and dorsal limb trajectories. The cellular logic that guides motor axon trajectory choices into non-limb tissues such as the ventral flank remains unclear. RESULTS: We determined the spinal cord motor column origin of motor nerves that innervate ventral flank tissues at hindlimb level. We found unexpectedly that a subset of medial LMC axons innervates ventral non-limb mesenchyme at hindlimb level, rather than entering ventral limb mesenchyme. We also found that in a conditional BmprIa mutant where all ventral hindlimb mesenchyme is converted to a dorsal identity, all medial LMC axons are redirected into the ventral flank, while lateral LMC axons innervate the bidorsal limb. CONCLUSION: We have found that medial LMC neurons innervate both ventral flank and limb targets. While normally only a subset of medial LMC axons innervate the flank, all are capable of doing so. Furthermore, LMC axons execute a ternary, rather than binary, choice at the base of the limb between ventral flank, ventral limb and dorsal limb trajectories. When making this choice, medial and lateral LMC axons exhibit different and asymmetric relative preferences for these three trajectories. These data redefine the LMC as a motor column that innervates both limb and body tissues.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"16943278","pmcid":null,"title":"BMP signaling in the epiblast is required for proper recruitment of the prospective paraxial mesoderm and development of the somites.","authors":["Miura S","Davis S","Klingensmith J","Mishina Y"],"grantIds":["P01HD39948","R01DE013674"],"grantAgencies":["NICHD NIH HHS","NIDCR NIH HHS","Intramural NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":13,"month":10,"year":2006,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Body Patterning","Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors, Type I","Bone Morphogenetic Proteins","Embryonic Development","Fibroblast Growth Factors","Mesoderm","Mice","Mice, Mutant Strains","Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1","Signal Transduction","Somites"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Bmpr1a encodes the BMP type IA receptor for bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), including 2 and 4.

Established models suggest that bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) directly trigger such PCD, although no direct genetic evidence exists for this. Alternatively, BMPs might indirectly affect PCD by regulating fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), which act as cell survival factors. Here, we inactivated the mouse BMP receptor gene Bmpr1a specifically in the limb bud apical ectodermal ridge (AER), a source of FGF activity. Early inactivation completely prevents AER formation. However, inactivation after limb bud initiation causes an upregulation of two AER-FGFs, Fgf4 and Fgf8, and a loss of interdigital PCD leading to webbed limbs. To determine whether excess FGF signaling inhibits interdigit PCD in these Bmpr1a mutant limbs, we performed double and triple AER-specific inactivations of Bmpr1a, Fgf4 and Fgf8. Webbing persists in AER-specific inactivations of Bmpr1a and Fgf8 owing to elevated Fgf4 expression. Inactivation of Bmpr1a, Fgf8 and one copy of Fgf4 eliminates webbing.

They arise from failure of endocardial cushion formation, a process dependent on transition of endothelial cells into clustered mesenchymal cells in the mid-atrioventricular septum. To date, the genetic signals necessary for atrioventricular canal defects are poorly understood. We hypothesized that bone morphogenetic protein signaling in cardiac endothelial cells may be crucial to this process. METHODS: To study the role of bone morphogenetic protein receptors (Bmpr) in the developing heart, we created knockout mice with inactivation of Bmpr1a selectively in endocardium. Two strains of null mice were created: one with constitutive endothelial-specific knockout of Bmpr1a and one with time-inducible, endothelial-specific knockout of Bmpr1a. Embryos and animals were analyzed by microscopy, RNA in situ hybridization, and microangiography. RESULTS: Animals with null mutation of Bmpr1a in endothelium were embryonic lethal at E11.5 to 12.0 and demonstrated absence of endocardial cushion formation. Embryos failed to form atrioventricular valves and adjacent septa. Endocardial knockout of Bmpr1a did not affect development of the outflow tract or aortic arches. Using time-inducible, cell-specific knockout mice, we show that Bmpr1a has two functions in the developing atrioventricular canal: to induce endocardial endothelial-mesenchymal transition, and to pattern the septal mesenchyme into endocardial cushions. We demonstrate that these processes are temporally linked to expression of the transcription factors Id1 and Id3. CONCLUSIONS: Endocardial cushion formation is dependent on cell-specific expression of Bmpr1a. Our results suggest that Bmpr1a-mediated signaling is a crucial pathway involved in pathogenesis of atrioventricular septal and valve malformations, which are among the most common congenital heart defects in humans.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"23197713","pmcid":null,"title":"BMP receptor 1A regulates development of hypothalamic circuits critical for feeding behavior.","authors":["Peng CY","Mukhopadhyay A","Jarrett JC","Yoshikawa K","Kessler JA"],"grantIds":["NS 20013","NS 20778","R01 NS020013","R01 NS020778","U54 CA151880"],"grantAgencies":["NINDS NIH HHS","NINDS NIH HHS","NINDS NIH HHS","NINDS NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","journalShort":"J.

Ablation of bone morphogenetic protein receptor 1a (BMPR1A) in the OLIG1 lineage resulted in hypophagia, hypoglycemia, and weight loss after the second postnatal week with death by week 4. Differentiation and specification of inhibitory hypothalamic neurons contributing to melanocortin and dopaminergic systems were abnormal in the BMPR1A-deficient ARH. Although the hypophagia promoted expression of the orexigenic neuropeptide agouti related protein (AgRP) in the BMPR1A-deficient ARH, there was a profound decrease of AgRP(+) axonal terminals in the mutant ARH targets including dorsomedial and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei. Projection of AgRP(+) neurons to these nuclei is known to be regulated by leptin. Leptin injection in neonatal mice increased bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling in the ventral hypothalamus, and blocking BMP signaling prevented leptin-induced neurite outgrowth in ARH explant cultures. These findings suggest that BMPR1A signaling is critical for postnatal establishment of leptin-responsive orexigenic fibers from ARH to multiple hypothalamic nuclei.

BMPs signal by binding to heteromeric serine-threonine kinase receptors formed by type I (BMPR1a, BMPR1b, Alk2) and type II (BMPRII) subunits. To determine the specific role of the BMPR1a subunit in lineage commitment by olig1-expressing cells, we used a cre/loxP genetic approach to ablate BMPR1a in these cells while leaving signaling from other subunits intact. There was a reduction in numbers of immature oligodendrocytes in the BMPR1a-null mutant brains at birth. However, by postnatal day 20, the BMPR1a-null mice had a significant increase in the number of mature and immature oligodendrocytes compared with wild-type littermates. There was also an increase in the proportion of calbindin-positive interneurons in the dorsomedial cortex of BMPR1a-null mice at birth without any change in the number of parvalbumin- or calretinin-positive cells. These effects were attributable, at least in part, to a decrease in the length of the cell cycle in subventricular zone progenitor cells. Thus, our findings indicate that BMPR1a mediates the suppressive effects of BMP signaling on oligodendrocyte lineage commitment and on the specification of calbindin-positive interneurons in the dorsomedial cortex.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"17928452","pmcid":null,"title":"The role of Foxg1 and dorsal midline signaling in the generation of Cajal-Retzius subtypes.","authors":["Hanashima C","Fernandes M","Hebert JM","Fishell G"],"grantIds":["R01MH068469","R01MH070596","R01NS032993"],"grantAgencies":["NIMH NIH HHS","NIMH NIH HHS","NINDS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","journalShort":"J.

Whether CR cells from distinct origins arise from disparate developmental processes or share a common mechanism is unclear. To elucidate the molecular basis of CR cell development, we assessed the role of both Foxg1 and dorsal midline signaling in the production of cortical hem- and PSB-derived CR cells. We demonstrate that the loss of Foxg1 results in the overproduction of both of these CR populations. However, removal of Foxg1 at embryonic day 13, although expanding the number of CR cells with a PSB phenotype, does not result in an expansion of BMPs or Wnts in the dorsomedial signaling center. Conversely, loss of the dorsal midline ligands as observed in Gli3 (glioma-associated oncogene homolog 3) mutants results in the loss of the cortical hem-derived CR character but does not affect the specification of PSB-derived CR cells. Hence, our findings demonstrate that, although the specification of cortical hem-derived CR cells is dependent on signaling from the dorsal midline, Foxg1 functions to repress the generation of both cortical hem- and PSB-derived CR cells.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"17678919","pmcid":null,"title":"Bone morphogenetic protein signaling is essential for terminal differentiation of the intestinal secretory cell lineage.","authors":["Auclair BA","Benoit YD","Rivard N","Mishina Y","Perreault N"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":["Intramural NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Gastroenterology","journalShort":"Gastroenterology","day":14,"month":9,"year":2007,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors, Type I","Bone Morphogenetic Proteins","Cell Differentiation","Cell Proliferation","Intestinal Mucosa","Jejunum","Mice","Mice, Inbred Strains","Mice, Transgenic","Mutation","Signal Transduction","Wnt Proteins","beta Catenin"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmps) are morphogens known to play key roles in gastrointestinal development and pathology. Most Bmps are produced primarily by the mesenchymal compartment and activate their signaling pathways following a paracrine or autocrine route. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of epithelial Bmp signaling in intestinal morphogenesis and maintenance of adult epithelial cell functions. METHODS: With the use of tissue-specific gene ablation, we generated mice lacking the Bmp receptor type IA (Bmpr1a) exclusively in the intestinal epithelium. Bmpr1a mutant and control mice were sacrificed for histology, immunofluorescence, Western blot analysis, electron microscopy, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: As well as showing increased proliferation and altered intestinal epithelial morphology, Bmpr1a mutant mice revealed that epithelial Bmp signaling is associated with impaired terminal differentiation of cells from the secretory lineage but not with the determination of cell fate. Loss of Bmp signaling exclusively in the epithelial compartment is not sufficient for the initiation of the de novo crypt phenomenon associated with juvenile polyposis syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Epithelial Bmp signaling plays an important role in the terminal differentiation of the intestinal secretory cell lineage but not in de novo crypt formation. These findings emphasize the importance of delineating the contribution of the stroma vs the epithelium in gastrointestinal physiology and pathology.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"18233958","pmcid":null,"title":"Reduced BMP4 abundance in Gata2 hypomorphic mutant mice result in uropathies resembling human CAKUT.","authors":["Hoshino T","Shimizu R","Ohmori S","Nagano M","Pan X","Ohneda O","Khandekar M","Yamamoto M","Lim KC","Engel JD"],"grantIds":["GM28896"],"grantAgencies":["NIGMS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms","journalShort":"Genes Cells","day":31,"month":2,"year":2008,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Base Sequence","Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4","Bone Morphogenetic Proteins","DNA Primers","Disease Models, Animal","Female","GATA2 Transcription Factor","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Heterozygote","Humans","Introns","Male","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Mice, Knockout","Mice, Mutant Strains","Models, Biological","Phenotype","Pregnancy","RNA, Messenger","Transcription, Genetic","Transcriptional Activation","Urogenital Abnormalities","Urogenital System"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Constitutive loss of transcription factor GATA-2 leads to embryonic lethality from primitive erythropoietic failure.

The transcription factor paired box 3 (Pax3) is expressed by multipotent neural crest precursors and is implicated in neural crest disorders in humans such as Waardenburg syndrome. Pax3 is required for development of multiple neural crest lineages and for activation of lineage-specific programs, yet expression is generally extinguished once neural crest cells migrate from the dorsal neural tube and differentiate. Using a murine Cre-inducible system, we asked whether persistent Pax3 expression in neural crest derivatives would affect development or patterning. We found that persistent expression of Pax3 in cranial neural crest cells resulted in cleft palate, ocular defects, malformation of the sphenoid bone, and perinatal lethality. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Pax3 directly regulates expression of Sostdc1, a soluble inhibitor of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. Persistent Pax3 expression renders the cranial crest resistant to BMP-induced osteogenesis. Thus, one mechanism by which Pax3 maintains the undifferentiated state of neural crest mesenchyme may be to block responsiveness to differentiation signals from the environment. These studies provide in vivo evidence for the importance of Pax3 downregulation during differentiation of multipotent neural crest precursors and cranial development.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"17553962","pmcid":null,"title":"Loss of a quiescent niche but not follicle stem cells in the absence of bone morphogenetic protein signaling.","authors":["Kobielak K","Stokes N","de la Cruz J","Polak L","Fuchs E"],"grantIds":["R01 AR 050452"],"grantAgencies":["NIAMS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","journalShort":"Proc.

Developmental studies have long implicated the canonical bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway in hair follicle (HF) determination and differentiation, but how BMP signaling functions in the hair follicle SC niche remains unknown. Here, we use loss and gain of function studies to manipulate BMP signaling in the SC niche. We show that when the Bmpr1a gene is conditionally ablated, otherwise quiescent SCs are activated to proliferate, causing an expansion of the niche and loss of slow-cycling cells. Surprisingly, follicle SCs are not lost, however, but rather, they generate long-lived, tumor-like branches that express Sox4, Lhx2, and Sonic Hedgehog but fail to terminally differentiate to make hair. A key component of BMPR1A-deficient SCs is their elevated levels of both Lef1 and beta-catenin, which form a bipartite transcription complex required for initiation of the hair cycle. Although beta-catenin can be stabilized by Wnt signaling, we show that BMPR1A deficiency enhances beta-catenin stabilization in the niche through a pathway involving PTEN inhibition and PI3K/AKT activation. Conversely, sustained BMP signaling in the SC niche blocks activation and promotes premature hair follicle differentiation.

CONCLUSIONS: The present findings demonstrate that bone morphogenetic protein signaling is required in the myocardium of the AV canal for proper AV junction development, including the AV node.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"18079409","pmcid":null,"title":"Smooth muscle protein 22alpha-mediated patchy deletion of Bmpr1a impairs cardiac contractility but protects against pulmonary vascular remodeling.","authors":["El-Bizri N","Wang L","Merklinger SL","Guignabert C","Desai T","Urashima T","Sheikh AY","Knutsen RH","Mecham RP","Mishina Y","Rabinovitch M"],"grantIds":["R01 HL074186","R01 HL074186","R01 HL074186-01A1","R01 HL074186-02","R01 HL074186-03","R01 HL074186-04"],"grantAgencies":["NHLBI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","Intramural NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Circulation research","journalShort":"Circ.

The LacZ distribution reflected patchy deletion of Bmpr1a in the lung vessels, aorta, and heart of SM22alpha;TRE-Cre;R26R;Bmpr1a(flox/+) and flox/flox mutants. This reduction in BMPR-IA expression was confirmed by Western immunoblot and immunohistochemistry in the flox/flox group.

However, both SM22alpha;TRE-Cre;R26R;Bmpr1a(flox/+) and flox/flox mutant mice had fewer muscularized distal pulmonary arteries and attenuated loss of peripheral pulmonary arteries compared with age-matched control littermates in hypoxia. When Bmpr1a expression was reduced by short interference RNA in cultured pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells, serum-induced proliferation was attenuated explaining decreased hypoxia-mediated muscularization of distal vessels. When Bmpr1a was reduced in cultured microvascular pericytes by short interference RNA, resistance to apoptosis was observed and this could account for protection against hypoxia-mediated vessel loss. The similar elevation in RV systolic pressure and RV hypertrophy, despite the attenuated remodeling with chronic hypoxia in the flox/flox mutants versus controls, was not a function of elevated left ventricular end diastolic pressure but was associated with increased periadventitial deposition of elastin and collagen, potentially influencing vascular stiffness.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"18000065","pmcid":null,"title":"Distinct roles of Wnt/beta-catenin and Bmp signaling during early cardiogenesis.","authors":["Klaus A","Saga Y","Taketo MM","Tzahor E","Birchmeier W"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","journalShort":"Proc.

For normal sexual development to occur, one duct must differentiate into its corresponding organs, and the other must regress. In mammals, the Wolffian duct differentiates into the male reproductive tract, mainly the vasa deferentia, epididymides, and seminal vesicles, whereas the Müllerian duct develops into the four components of the female reproductive tract, the oviducts, uterus, cervix, and upper third of the vagina. In males, the fetal Leydig cells produce testosterone, which stimulates the differentiation of the Wolffian duct, whereas the Sertoli cells of the fetal testes express anti-Müllerian hormone, which activates the regression of the Müllerian duct. Anti-Müllerian hormone is a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family of secreted signaling molecules and has been shown to signal through the BMP pathway. It binds to its type II receptor, anti-Müllerian hormone receptor 2 (AMHR2), in the Müllerian duct mesenchyme and through an unknown mechanism(s); the mesenchyme induces the regression of the Müllerian duct mesoepithelium.

Microarrays in hearts from transgenic compared to wild-type mice showed an upregulation of the BMP receptors Alk3 and BMPR-II, and of their ligand BMP4 (P<0.01 versus wild type). Activation of the BMP pathway in transgenic mice was confirmed by increased phosphorylation of the \"canonical\" BMP effectors Smad 1/5/8 (P<0.01 versus wild type). In isolated myocytes, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of H11K was accompanied by a significant (P<0.01) increase in PI3K activity, phospho-Akt, Smad 1/5/8 phosphorylation and [(3)H]phenylalanine incorporation, and by a 70% reduction in H(2)O(2)-mediated apoptosis. All these effects were abolished by the BMP antagonist noggin. In presence of BMP4, Smad 1/5/8 phosphorylation was enhanced by 5-fold on H11K overexpression but decreased by 3-fold on H11K knockdown (P<0.01 versus control), showing that H11K potentiates the BMP signaling.

Thus, loss of Bmpr1a, by decreasing MMP2 and/or MMP9 activity, can account for vascular dilatation and persistence of brain microvessels, leading to the impaired organogenesis documented in the brain.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"18272846","pmcid":null,"title":"Bmp in podocytes is essential for normal glomerular capillary formation.","authors":["Ueda H","Miyazaki Y","Matsusaka T","Utsunomiya Y","Kawamura T","Hosoya T","Ichikawa I"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN","journalShort":"J.

At birth, Tg(Nphs1-Nog) mice, which had loss of BMP4 function in podocytes, were found to have glomerular microaneurysms, collapsed glomerular capillary tufts, enlarged Bowman's capsules, and fewer normal proximal tubules. Conversely, Tg(Nphs1-Bmp4) mice, which had increased BMP4 function in podocytes, demonstrated defects in glomerular capillary formation, but podocytes were not appreciably affected. The Tg(Nphs1-Nog) and Tg(Nphs1-Bmp4) mice shared morphological characteristics with the previously reported podocyte-specific Vegf-A over-expressing and knockout mice, respectively. Consistent with the morphological similarity, in situ hybridization revealed an intense signal for podocyte expression of Vegf in Tg(Nphs1-Nog) mice, whereas the signal was markedly suppressed in Tg(Nphs1-Bmp4) mice. However, in vitro studies with metanephroi failed to demonstrate a direct interaction between BMP4 or Noggin and VEGF in podocytes. Instead, immunostaining showed that phosphorylated Smads, the mediators of BMP signaling, are present in endothelial and/or mesangial cells, but not in podocytes, within the developing glomeruli. Therefore, this study suggests that podocyte-derived BMP plays an important role in glomerular capillary formation, perhaps by acting on non-podocyte glomerular cells in a paracrine fashion.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"19224984","pmcid":null,"title":"BMP canonical Smad signaling through Smad1 and Smad5 is required for endochondral bone formation.","authors":["Retting KN","Song B","Yoon BS","Lyons KM"],"grantIds":["AR44528","R01 AR044528","R01 AR044528-10"],"grantAgencies":["NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":9,"month":4,"year":2009,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Bone Morphogenetic Proteins","Cell Differentiation","Cell Proliferation","Cell Survival","Chondrocytes","Chondrogenesis","Extremities","Female","Fibroblast Growth Factors","Hedgehog Proteins","Male","Mice","Mice, Knockout","Mice, Mutant Strains","Osteogenesis","Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein","Phosphorylation","Signal Transduction","Smad1 Protein","Smad4 Protein","Smad5 Protein","Smad8 Protein"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling is required for endochondral bone formation.

The temporally and spatially regulated expression of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and their receptors in the retina are thought to play a key role in this process, initiating gene expression cascades that distinguish different regions of the retina, particularly along the dorsoventral axis. Here, we examine the role of BMP and a potential downstream effector, EphB, in retinotopic map formation in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and superior colliculus (SC). RGC axon behaviors during retinotopic map formation in wild-type mice are compared with those in several strains of mice with engineered defects of BMP and EphB signaling. Normal RGC axon sorting produces axon order in the optic tract that reflects the dorsoventral position of the parent RGCs in the eye. A dramatic consequence of disrupting BMP signaling is a missorting of RGC axons as they exit the optic chiasm. This sorting is not dependent on EphB. When BMP signaling in the developing eye is genetically modified, RGC order in the optic tract and targeting in the LGN and SC are correspondingly disrupted. These experiments show that BMP signaling regulates dorsoventral RGC cell fate, RGC axon behavior in the ascending optic tract, and retinotopic map formation in the LGN and SC through mechanisms that are in part distinct from EphB signaling in the LGN and SC.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"19153163","pmcid":null,"title":"Consequences of axon guidance defects on the development of retinotopic receptive fields in the mouse colliculus.","authors":["Chandrasekaran AR","Furuta Y","Crair MC"],"grantIds":["P30 EY000785","R01 EY015788","R01 EY015788","R01 MH062639"],"grantAgencies":["NEI NIH HHS","NEI NIH HHS","NEI NIH HHS","NIMH NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"The Journal of physiology","journalShort":"J.

During and subsequent to this period, spontaneous waves of action potentials sweep across the retina, providing an instructive topographic signal based on the correlations of firing patterns of neighbouring RGCs. How these activity-independent and activity-dependent factors interact during retinotopic map formation remains unclear. A typical phenotype of mutant mice lacking genes for one or more RGC axon guidance molecules is the presence of topographically inappropriate projections or 'ectopic spots'. Here, we examine mice that lack functional bone morphogenetic protein receptors (BMPRs) in the retina. Retinal BMP controls the graded expression of RGC axon guidance molecules, resulting in some dorsal RGCs projecting ectopically to locations in the SC that normally receive input from ventral retina. We examine the consequences of this anatomical phenotype in vivo by studying the receptive field (RF) properties of neurons in the superficial SC. We observe a mixture of physiological phenotypes in BMPR mutant mice; notably we find some neurons with ectopic RFs displaced in elevation, corresponding to the observed anatomical defect. However, in a result not necessarily congruent with the presence of focal ectopic projections, some neurons have split, enlarged and patchy/distorted RFs. These results are consistent with the effects of spontaneous retinal waves acting upon a disrupted molecular template, and they place significant limits on the form of an activity-dependent learning rule for the development of retinocollicular projections.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"19442313","pmcid":"2685768","title":"Myoblast sensitivity and fibroblast insensitivity to osteogenic conversion by BMP-2 correlates with the expression of Bmpr-1a.","authors":["Liu R","Ginn SL","Lek M","North KN","Alexander IE","Little DG","Schindeler A"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"BMC musculoskeletal disorders","journalShort":"BMC Musculoskelet Disord","day":25,"month":5,"year":2009,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Biological Markers","Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2","Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors","Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors, Type I","Calcification, Physiologic","Cell Differentiation","Cell Lineage","Cell Proliferation","Cells, Cultured","Feedback, Physiological","Fibroblasts","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","MyoD Protein","Myoblasts","NIH 3T3 Cells","Osteogenesis","Stem Cells","Transduction, Genetic","Up-Regulation"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"BACKGROUND: Osteoblasts are considered to primarily arise from osseous progenitors within the periosteum or bone marrow. We have speculated that cells from local soft tissues may also take on an osteogenic phenotype. Myoblasts are known to adopt a bone gene program upon treatment with the osteogenic bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP-2,-4,-6,-7,-9), but their osteogenic capacity relative to other progenitor types is unclear. We further hypothesized that the sensitivity of cells to BMP-2 would correlate with BMP receptor expression. METHODS: We directly compared the BMP-2 sensitivity of myoblastic murine cell lines and primary cells with osteoprogenitors from osseous tissues and fibroblasts. Fibroblasts forced to undergo myogenic conversion by transduction with a MyoD-expressing lentiviral vector (LV-MyoD) were also examined. Outcome measures included alkaline phosphatase expression, matrix mineralization, and expression of osteogenic genes (alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin and bone morphogenetic protein receptor-1A) as measured by quantitative PCR. RESULTS: BMP-2 induced a rapid and robust osteogenic response in myoblasts and osteoprogenitors, but not in fibroblasts. Myoblasts and osteoprogenitors grown in osteogenic media rapidly upregulated Bmpr-1a expression. Chronic BMP-2 treatment resulted in peak Bmpr-1a expression at day 6 before declining, suggestive of a negative feedback mechanism. In contrast, fibroblasts expressed low levels of Bmpr-1a that was only weakly up-regulated by BMP-2 treatment. Bioinformatics analysis confirmed the presence of myogenic responsive elements in the proximal promoter region of human and murine BMPR-1A/Bmpr-1a. Forced myogenic gene expression in fibroblasts was associated with a significant increase in Bmpr-1a expression and a synergistic increase in the osteogenic response to BMP-2. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate the osteogenic sensitivity of muscle progenitors and provide a mechanistic insight into the variable response of different cell lineages to BMP-2.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"19141668","pmcid":null,"title":"Embryonic hair follicle fate change by augmented beta-catenin through Shh and Bmp signaling.","authors":["Suzuki K","Yamaguchi Y","Villacorte M","Mihara K","Akiyama M","Shimizu H","Taketo MM","Nakagata N","Tsukiyama T","Yamaguchi TP","Birchmeier W","Kato S","Yamada G"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":14,"month":2,"year":2009,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2","Cell Differentiation","Epidermis","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Hair Follicle","Hedgehog Proteins","Keratinocytes","Keratins, Hair-Specific","Mice","Mice, Mutant Strains","Mutation","Signal Transduction","beta Catenin"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"beta-catenin signaling is one of the key factors regulating the fate of hair follicles (HFs).

Limb bud outgrowth is driven by signals in a positive feedback loop involving fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) genes, sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Gremlin1 (Grem1). Precise termination of these signals is essential to restrict limb bud size. The current model predicts a sequence of signal termination consistent with that in chick limb buds. Our finding that the sequence in mouse limb buds is different led us to explore alternative mechanisms. Here we show, by analysing compound mouse mutants defective in genes comprising the positive loop, genetic evidence that FGF signalling can repress Grem1 expression, revealing a novel Fgf/Grem1 inhibitory loop. This repression occurs both in mouse and chick limb buds, and is dependent on high FGF activity. These data support a mechanism where the positive Fgf/Shh loop drives outgrowth and an increase in FGF signalling, which triggers the Fgf/Grem1 inhibitory loop. The inhibitory loop then operates to terminate outgrowth signals in the order observed in either mouse or chick limb buds.

The purpose of this study was to define the mechanisms regulating the spatial patterning of cone opsin expression. By analyzing knock-outs for bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, we found an essential role for BMP in forming cone opsin expression patterns in the retina; however, BMP signaling is activated only transiently in the dorsal half of the retina during early retinal development. Thus, BMP is not likely to play a direct role in opsin gene expression, which starts at a later stage of retinal development.

Screening of other patients by qPCR revealed a similar duplication in a second family. The duplicated region contains evolutionary highly conserved sequences suggestive of a long-range regulator. By using a transgenic mouse model we can show that this sequence is able to drive expression of a X-Gal reporter construct in the limbs. The almost complete overlap with endogenous Bmp2 expression indicates that a limb-specific enhancer of Bmp2 is located within the identified duplication. Our results reveal an additional functional mechanism for the pathogenesis of BDA2, which is duplication of a regulatory element that affects the expression of BMP2 in the developing limb.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"19369394","pmcid":null,"title":"FGF-regulated BMP signaling is required for eyelid closure and to specify conjunctival epithelial cell fate.","authors":["Huang J","Dattilo LK","Rajagopal R","Liu Y","Kaartinen V","Mishina Y","Deng CX","Umans L","Zwijsen A","Roberts AB","Beebe DC"],"grantIds":["EY04853","P30 EY02687","R01 EY004853","R01 EY004853-26"],"grantAgencies":["NEI NIH HHS","NEI NIH HHS","NEI NIH HHS","NEI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":27,"month":5,"year":2009,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4","Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors, Type I","Bone Morphogenetic Proteins","Cell Differentiation","Conjunctiva","Epithelial Cells","Eyelids","Fibroblast Growth Factors","Forkhead Transcription Factors","Hair Follicle","Hedgehog Proteins","JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases","Mice","Mice, Knockout","Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2","Signal Transduction","Smad Proteins, Receptor-Regulated","Smad4 Protein"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"There are conflicting reports about whether BMP signaling is required for eyelid closure during fetal development.

Only mice with deletion of components of the BMP pathway had an 'eyelid open at birth' phenotype. Mice lacking Fgf10 or Fgfr2 also have open eyelids at birth. To better understand the pathways that regulate BMP expression and function during eyelid development, we localized BMPs and BMP signaling intermediates in Fgfr2 and Smad4 conditional knockout (CKO) mice. We found that Fgfr2 was required for the expression of Bmp4, the normal distribution of Shh signaling and for preserving the differentiation of the conjunctival epithelium. FGF signaling also promoted the expression of the Wnt antagonist Sfrp1 and suppressed Wnt signaling in the prospective eyelid epithelial cells, independently of BMP function.

However, as BMP signaling via cNCC is also required for proper development of the outflow tract cushions, precursors to the semilunar valves, a plausible alternate or additional hypothesis is that heart failure may result from an outflow tract cushion defect. To investigate whether the outflow tract cushions may serve as dynamic valves in regulating hemodynamic function in the early embryo, in this study we used noninvasive ultrasound biomicroscopy-Doppler imaging to quantitatively assess hemodynamic function in mouse embryos with P0-Cre transgene mediated neural crest ablation of Bmpr1a (P0 mutants). Similar to previous studies, the neural crest-deleted Bmpr1a P0 mutants died at approximately E12.5, exhibiting persistent truncus arteriosus, thinned myocardium, and congestive heart failure. Surprisingly, our ultrasound analyses showed normal contractile indices, heart rate, and atrioventricular conduction in the P0 mutants. However, reversed diastolic arterial blood flow was detected as early as E11.5, with cardiovascular insufficiency and death rapidly ensuing by E12.5. Quantitative computed tomography showed thinning of the outflow cushions, and this was associated with a marked reduction in cell proliferation. These results suggest BMP signaling to cNCC is required for growth of the outflow tract cushions.

Here, we present a detailed study of the developmental expression profiles of three BMP ligands (Bmp2, Bmp4, Bmp7) and three BMP receptors (Bmpr1a, Bmpr1b, and BmprII), as well as their molecular antagonist (noggin), in the early embryo during the initial steps of murine organogenesis. In particular, we focus on the expression of Bmp family members in the first organs and tissues that take shape during embryogenesis, such as the heart, vascular system, lungs, liver, stomach, nervous system, somites and limbs. Using in situ hybridization, we identify domains where ligand(s) and receptor(s) are either singly or co-expressed in specific tissues.

The role of the 263 amino acids of the pro-peptide is currently unclear. In order to obtain an insight into the function of the pro-form (proBMP-2), the ability of proBMP-2 to induce alkaline phosphatase (AP), a marker enzyme for cells differentiating into osteoblasts, was tested. Interestingly, in contrast to mature BMP-2, proBMP-2 did not lead to induction of AP. Instead, proBMP-2 inhibited the induction of AP by BMP-2. This result raised the question of whether proBMP-2 may compete with mature BMP-2 for receptor binding. ProBMP-2 was found to bind to the purified extracellular ligand binding domain (ECD) of BMPR-IA, a high-affinity receptor for mature BMP-2, with a similar affinity as mature BMP-2. Binding of proBMP-2 to BMPR-IA was confirmed in cell culture by cross-linking proBMP-2 to BMPR-IA presented on the cell surface. In contrast to this finding, proBMP-2 did not bind to the ECD of BMPR-II. ProBMP-2 also differed from BMP-2 in its capacity to induce p38 and Smad phosphorylation.

The loss of Alk3 does not prevent NC cell migration, but the cells die immediately after reaching the dorsal aorta. The paired homeodomain factor Phox2b, known to be essential for survival of SNS precursors, is downregulated, suggesting that Phox2b is a target of BMP signaling.

BMPs are potent morphogens that are involved in cell fate determination, proliferation, apoptosis and adult tissue homeostasis. Twisted gastrulation (TWSG1) is a secreted BMP binding protein that modulates BMP ligand availability in the extracellular space. Here we investigate the consequences of TWSG1 deletion on development of the postnatal MG. At puberty, Twsg1 is expressed in the myoepithelium and in a subset of body cells of the terminal end buds. In the mature duct, Twsg1 expression is primarily restricted to the myoepithelial layer. Global deletion of Twsg1 leads to a delay in ductal elongation, reduced secondary branching, enlarged terminal end buds, and occluded lumens. This is associated with an increase in luminal epithelial cell number and a decrease in apoptosis. In the MG, pSMAD1/5/8 level and the expression of BMP target genes are reduced, consistent with a decrease in BMP signaling. GATA-3, which is required for luminal identity, is reduced in Twsg1(-/-) MGs, which may explain why K14 positive cells, which are normally restricted to the myoepithelial layer, are found within the luminal compartment and shed into the lumen. In summary, regulation of BMP signaling by TWSG1 is required for normal ductal elongation, branching of the ductal tree, lumen formation, and myoepithelial compartmentalization in the postnatal MG.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"19793892","pmcid":null,"title":"Talin 1 and 2 are required for myoblast fusion, sarcomere assembly and the maintenance of myotendinous junctions.","authors":["Conti FJ","Monkley SJ","Wood MR","Critchley DR","Müller U"],"grantIds":["MH078833","NS046456"],"grantAgencies":["NIMH NIH HHS","NINDS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":12,"month":11,"year":2009,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Cell Fusion","Cytoskeleton","Integrins","Mice","Mice, Knockout","Muscle, Skeletal","Muscular Diseases","Sarcomeres","Talin"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Talin 1 and 2 connect integrins to the actin cytoskeleton and regulate the affinity of integrins for ligands.

In Bmpr1a(null/flox); Sox2Cre embryos, a drastic decrease of WNT signaling is observed at E6.0. Addition of WNT3A to the culture of Bmpr1a(null/flox); Sox2Cre embryos at E5.5 restores expression patterns of Dkk1 and Cer1. These data indicate that BMP signaling in the epiblast induces Wnt3 and Wnt3a expression to maintain WNT signaling in the VE, resulting in downregulation of Dkk1 to establish the anterior expression domain. Thus, our results suggest that BMP signaling regulates the expression patterns of Dkk1 for anterior migration of the AVE.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"20130285","pmcid":null,"title":"Regulation of retinal progenitor cell differentiation by bone morphogenetic protein 4 is mediated by the smad/id cascade.","authors":["Du Y","Xiao Q","Yip HK"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Investigative ophthalmology & visual science","journalShort":"Invest.

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are secreted signaling molecules that are implicated in the control of multiple events during mouse eye development. However, little is known about the mechanisms by which BMP signaling regulates these retinal developmental processes. METHODS. Real-time PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry were used to investigate the expression of components of BMP signaling in the mouse retina. Retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) were used to study the effects of BMP4 on retinal cell differentiation and regulation of Id protein expression. RESULTS. Results showed that BMP2, -4, and -7; BMP receptor (BMPRIb) mRNAs; and proteins and downstream signaling molecule Smad1/5/8 proteins were all highly expressed in the mouse retina during the embryonic (E13.5-E18.5) and early postnatal (P)1 stage and that the expression was downregulated in the adult. On stimulation with BMP4, cultured mouse RPCs differentiated into neuronal lineage whereas astrocyte cell differentiation was inhibited. BMP4 mainly stimulated production of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Results also revealed that BMPs and BMPRIb were co-localized with inhibitors of differentiation (Id) (mainly Id1 and -3) in RGCs in the adult mouse retina. Exposure of RPCs to BMP4 upregulated Id1-3 expression levels, mediated through the phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 proteins. CONCLUSIONS. These results suggest that Id genes are one of the potential targets of BMP signaling in the differentiation of RPCs.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"20522595","pmcid":"2911072","title":"Mesenchymal bone morphogenetic protein signaling is required for normal pancreas development.","authors":["Ahnfelt-Rønne J","Ravassard P","Pardanaud-Glavieux C","Scharfmann R","Serup P"],"grantIds":["U19 DK072495"],"grantAgencies":["NIDDK NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Diabetes","journalShort":"Diabetes","day":29,"month":8,"year":2010,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2","Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4","Bone Morphogenetic Protein 5","Bone Morphogenetic Proteins","Cell Differentiation","Chick Embryo","Embryo, Mammalian","Mesenteric Veins","Mesoderm","Mice","Neovascularization, Physiologic","Pancreas","Signal Transduction"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Pancreas organogenesis is orchestrated by interactions between the epithelium and the mesenchyme, but these interactions are not completely understood.

RESULTS: Endogenous BMP signaling is confined to the mesenchyme in the early pancreas and inhibition of BMP signaling results in severe pancreatic hypoplasia with reduced epithelial branching. Notably, we also observed an excessive endocrine differentiation when mesenchymal BMP signaling is blocked, presumably secondary to defective mesenchyme to epithelium signaling.

We investigated the role of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling in gliosis after SCI and find that BMPR1a and BMPR1b signaling exerts opposing effects on hypertrophy. Conditional ablation of BMPR1a from glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-expressing cells leads to defective astrocytic hypertrophy, increased infiltration by inflammatory cells, and reduced axon density. BMPR1b-null mice conversely develop \"hyperactive\" reactive astrocytes and consequently have smaller lesion volumes. The effects of ablation of either receptor are reversed in the double knock-out animals. These findings indicate that BMPR1a and BMPR1b exert directly opposing effects on the initial reactive astrocytic hypertrophy. Also, BMPR1b knock-out mice have an attenuated glial scar in the chronic stages following injury, suggesting that it has a greater role in glial scar progression. To elucidate the differing roles of the two receptors in astrocytes, we examined the effects of ablation of either receptor in serum-derived astrocytes in vitro. We find that the two receptors exert opposing effects on the posttranscriptional regulation of astrocytic microRNA-21. Further, overexpression of microRNA-21 in wild-type serum-derived astrocytes causes a dramatic reduction in cell size accompanied by reduction in GFAP levels. Hence, regulation of microRNA-21 by BMP signaling provides a novel mechanism for regulation of astrocytic size. Targeting specific BMPR subunits for therapeutic purposes may thus provide an approach for manipulating gliosis and enhancing functional outcomes after SCI.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"19733164","pmcid":null,"title":"The type I BMP receptors, Bmpr1a and Acvr1, activate multiple signaling pathways to regulate lens formation.","authors":["Rajagopal R","Huang J","Dattilo LK","Kaartinen V","Mishina Y","Deng CX","Umans L","Zwijsen A","Roberts AB","Beebe DC"],"grantIds":["5R01DE013085","5R01HL074862","EY02687","EY04853","R01 EY004853","R01 EY004853-26"],"grantAgencies":["NIDCR NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NEI NIH HHS","NEI NIH HHS","NEI NIH HHS","NEI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Developmental biology","journalShort":"Dev.

Bmpr1a and Acvr1 regulated cell survival and proliferation, respectively. Absence of both receptors interfered with the expression of proteins involved in normal lens development and prevented lens formation, demonstrating that BMPs induce lens formation by acting directly on the prospective lens ectoderm. Remarkably, the canonical Smad signaling pathway was not needed for most of these processes. Lens formation, placode cell proliferation, the expression of FoxE3, a lens-specific transcription factor, and the lens protein, alphaA-crystallin were regulated by BMP receptors in a Smad-independent manner. Placode cell survival was promoted by R-Smad signaling, but in a manner that did not involve Smad4.

We therefore generated mice that were deficient in Bmpr1b constitutively, and deficient in Bmpr1a conditionally in the dorsal telencephalon. In double mutant male and female mice, the dentate gyrus (DG) was dramatically smaller than in control mice, reflecting decreased production of granule neurons at the peak period of DG neurogenesis. Additionally, the pool of cells that generates new DG neurons throughout life was reduced, commensurate with the smaller size of the DG. Effects of diminished BMP signaling on the cortical hem were at least partly responsible for these defects in DG development. Reduction of the DG and its major extrinsic output to CA3 raised the possibility that the DG was functionally compromised. We therefore looked for behavioral deficits in double mutants and found that the mice were less responsive to fear- or anxiety-provoking stimuli, whether the association of the stimulus with fear or anxiety was learned or innate. Given that no anatomical defects appeared in the double mutant telencephalon outside the DG, our observations support a growing literature that implicates the hippocampus in circuitry mediating fear and anxiety.

Finally, we show that nongenotoxic doses of tamoxifen could be used to specifically delete loxP-flanked Bmpr1a, the receptor for bone morphogenetic protein 2, 4, and 7, causing antral polyps and marked antral-pyloric hyperplasia, consistent with previous reports on Bmpr1a.

Female mice homozygous null for Bmpr1b are sterile due to compromised cumulus expansion, but the function of BMPR1A in the ovary is unknown. To further decipher a role for BMP signaling in mouse granulosa cells, we deleted Bmpr1a in the granulosa cells of the ovary and found Bmpr1a conditional knockout females to be subfertile with reduced spontaneous ovulation. To explore the redundant functions of BMP receptor signaling in the ovary, we generated Bmpr1a Bmpr1b double-mutant mice, which developed granulosa cell tumors that have evidence of increased TGFbeta and hedgehog signaling. Thus, similar to SMAD1 and SMAD5, which have redundant roles in suppressing granulosa cell tumor development in mice, two type I BMP receptors, BMPR1A and BMPR1B, function together to prevent ovarian tumorigenesis. These studies support a role for a functional BMP signaling axis as a tumor suppressor pathway in the ovary, with BMPR1A and BMPR1B acting downstream of BMP ligands and upstream of BMP receptor SMADs.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"20837004","pmcid":null,"title":"BMP/SMAD signaling regulates the cell behaviors that drive the initial dorsal-specific regional morphogenesis of the otocyst.","authors":["Ohta S","Mansour SL","Schoenwolf GC"],"grantIds":["DC004185","R01 DC004185-10","R01 DC011819"],"grantAgencies":["NIDCD NIH HHS","NIDCD NIH HHS","NIDCD NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Developmental biology","journalShort":"Dev.

BmprIa and BmprIb encode two type I BMP receptors that are primarily responsible for BMP signaling transduction. We investigated mesenchymal tissue-specific requirement of BmprIa and its functional redundancy with BmprIb during the development of mouse tooth and palate. BmprIa and BmprIb exhibit partially overlapping and distinct expression patterns in the developing tooth and palatal shelf. Neural crest-specific inactivation of BmprIa leads to formation of an unusual type of anterior clefting of the secondary palate, an arrest of tooth development at the bud/early cap stages, and severe hypoplasia of the mandible. Defective tooth and palate development is accompanied by the down-regulation of BMP-responsive genes and reduced cell proliferation levels in the palatal and dental mesenchyme. To determine if BmprIb could substitute for BmprIa during tooth and palate development, we expressed a constitutively active form of BmprIb (caBmprIb) in the neural crest cells in which BmprIa was simultaneously inactivated. We found that substitution of BmprIa by caBmprIb in neural rest cells rescues the development of molars and maxillary incisor, but the rescued teeth exhibit a delayed odontoblast and ameloblast differentiation. In contrast, caBmprIb fails to rescue the palatal and mandibular defects including the lack of lower incisors.

Reducing the dosage of the Wnt co-receptor genes Lrp5 and Lrp6 rescues the Wise-null tooth phenotypes. Inactivation of Wise leads to elevated Wnt signaling and, as a consequence, vestigial tooth buds in the normally toothless diastema region display increased proliferation and continuous development to form supernumerary teeth. Conversely, gain-of-function studies show that ectopic Wise reduces Wnt signaling and tooth number. Our analyses demonstrate that the Fgf and Shh pathways are major downstream targets of Wise-regulated Wnt signaling. Furthermore, our experiments revealed that Shh acts as a negative-feedback regulator of Wnt signaling and thus determines the fate of the vestigial buds and later tooth patterning.

In this study, we have examined the role of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling in regulating satellite cell function. Activated satellite cells expressed BMP receptor type 1A (BMPR-1A/Alk-3) and contained phosphorylated Smad proteins, indicating that BMP signalling is operating during proliferation. Indeed, exogenous BMP4 stimulated satellite cell division and inhibited myogenic differentiation. Conversely, interfering with the interactions between BMPs and their receptors by the addition of either the BMP antagonist Noggin or soluble BMPR-1A fragments, induced precocious differentiation. Similarly, blockade of BMP signalling by siRNA-mediated knockdown of BMPR-1A, disruption of the intracellular pathway by either Smad5 or Smad4 knockdown or inhibition of Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation with Dorsomorphin, also caused premature myogenic differentiation. BMP signalling acted to inhibit the upregulation of genes associated with differentiation, in part, through regulating Id1. As satellite cells differentiated, Noggin levels increased to antagonise BMP signalling, since Noggin knockdown enhanced proliferation and impeded myoblast fusion into large multinucleated myotubes. Finally, interference of normal BMP signalling after muscle damage in vivo perturbed the regenerative process, and resulted in smaller regenerated myofibres. In conclusion, BMP signalling operates during routine satellite cell function to help coordinate the balance between proliferation and differentiation, before Noggin is activated to antagonise BMPs and facilitate terminal differentiation.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"20554972","pmcid":null,"title":"Vegf regulates embryonic erythroid development through Gata1 modulation.","authors":["Drogat B","Kalucka J","Gutiérrez L","Hammad H","Goossens S","Farhang Ghahremani M","Bartunkova S","Haigh K","Deswarte K","Nyabi O","Naessens M","Ferrara N","Klingmüller U","Lambrecht BN","Nagy A","Philipsen S","Haigh JJ"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Blood","journalShort":"Blood","day":23,"month":9,"year":2010,"meshHeadings":["Cell Differentiation","Cell Line","Cell Lineage","Down-Regulation","Erythroid Cells","Erythropoiesis","GATA1 Transcription Factor","GATA2 Transcription Factor","RNA, Messenger","Transgenes","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"To determine the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) in embryonic erythroid development we have deleted or overexpressed Vegf specifically in the erythroid lineage using the EpoR-iCre transgenic line in combination with Cre/loxP conditional gain and loss of function Vegf alleles.

METHODS: Using a Cre/loxP-mediated conditional gene targeting approach, Smad4 gene function was deleted from the embryonic mouse retina. Mutant phenotypes were morphologically and molecularly examined. RESULTS: Loss of Smad4 in the developing retina led to varying degrees of microphthalmia at birth, presumably because of elevated apoptosis observed transiently at embryonic day 12.5 in the developing retina. This was also associated with an apparent delay in accumulation of retinal ganglion cells. Smad4 conditional mutants also exhibited alterations of retinal spatial patterning along the dorsal-ventral axis, consistent with a known function of BMP signaling in the embryonic retina. However, despite a known role for BMP signaling in retinal cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation, Smad4 mutant retinal progenitor cells were capable of maintaining growth and neurogenesis throughout embryonic development. We also found that the loss of Smad4 led to abnormal targeting of retinal ganglion cell axons to the optic nerve head, a phenotype consistent with reduced BMP signaling in the developing retina.

The CK2 blocking peptide activated the Wnt pathway. To identify the optimal peptide concentration and peptide concentration curves for mineralization studies were performed. We designed BMPRIa mutants with a point mutation in the CK2 phosphorylation site to establish a specific effect. Mineralization was initiated with the overexpression of the BMPRIa mutants indicating CK2 is a negative regulatory protein for osteoblast differentiation. Osteoclast differentiation and activity was decreased with the CK2 blocking peptide. Further, subcutaneous calvarial bone injections of a CK2 blocking peptide increased bone area, areal bone mineral density, and bone growth. These results indicate CK2 is crucial for osteoblast differentiation and could be a target for future therapeutics of fracture healing.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"21786321","pmcid":null,"title":"Conditional deletion of Bmpr1a in differentiated osteoclasts increases osteoblastic bone formation, increasing volume of remodeling bone in mice.","authors":["Okamoto M","Murai J","Imai Y","Ikegami D","Kamiya N","Kato S","Mishina Y","Yoshikawa H","Tsumaki N"],"grantIds":["DE020843"],"grantAgencies":["NIDCR NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research","journalShort":"J.

Although the effects of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signals on osteoblasts have been studied extensively, the function of BMP signals in osteoclasts has not been fully elucidated. To delineate the function of BMP signals in osteoclasts during bone remodeling, we deleted BMP receptor type IA (Bmpr1a) in an osteoclast-specific manner using a knock-in Cre mouse line to the cathepsin K locus (Ctsk(Cre/+);Bmpr1a(flox/flox), designated as Bmpr1a(ΔOc/ΔOc)). Cre was specifically expressed in multinucleated osteoclasts in vivo. Cre-dependent deletion of the Bmpr1a gene occurred at 4 days after cultivation of bone marrow macrophages obtained from Bmpr1a(ΔOc/ΔOc) with RANKL. These results suggested that Bmpr1a was deleted after formation of osteoclasts in Bmpr1a(ΔOc/ΔOc) mice. Expression of bone-resorption markers increased, thus suggesting that BMPRIA signaling negatively regulates osteoclast differentiation. Trabeculae in tibia and femurs were thickened in 3.5-, 8-, and 12-week-old Bmpr1a(ΔOc/ΔOc) mice. Bone histomorphometry revealed increased bone volume associated with increased osteoblastic bone-formation rates (BFR) in the remodeling bone of the secondary spongiosa in Bmpr1a(ΔOc/ΔOc) tibias at 8 weeks of age. For comparison, we also induced an osteoblast-specific deletion of Bmpr1a using Col1a1-Cre. The resulting mice showed increased bone volume with marked decreases in BFR in tibias at 8 weeks of age. These results indicate that deletion of Bmpr1a in differentiated osteoclasts increases osteoblastic bone formation, thus suggesting that BMPR1A signaling in osteoclasts regulates coupling to osteoblasts by reducing bone-formation activity during bone remodeling.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"21415412","pmcid":null,"title":"Epithelial BMP signaling is required for proper specification of epithelial cell lineages and gastric endocrine cells.","authors":["Maloum F","Allaire JM","Gagné-Sansfaçon J","Roy E","Belleville K","Sarret P","Morisset J","Carrier JC","Mishina Y","Kaestner KH","Perreault N"],"grantIds":["MOP-111104","R01-DK053839"],"grantAgencies":["Canadian Institutes of Health Research","NIDDK NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"American journal of physiology.

BMP ligands and their receptors are expressed in both epithelial and mesenchymal compartments, suggesting bidirectional signaling between these two entities. Despite an increasing interest in BMP signaling in gut physiology and pathologies, the distinct contribution of BMP signaling in the epithelium vs. the mesenchyme in gastrointestinal homeostasis remains to be established. We aimed to investigate the role of epithelial BMP signaling in gastric organogenesis, gland morphogenesis, and maintenance of epithelial cell functions. Using the Cre/loxP system, we generated a mouse model with an early deletion during development of BMP receptor 1A (Bmpr1a) exclusively in the foregut endoderm. Bmpr1a(ΔGEC) mice showed no severe abnormalities in gastric organogenesis, gland epithelial proliferation, or morphogenesis, suggesting only a minor role for epithelial BMP signaling in these processes. However, early loss of BMP signaling in foregut endoderm did impact on gastric patterning, leading to an anteriorization of the stomach. In addition, numbers of parietal cells were reduced in Bmpr1a(ΔGEC) mice. Epithelial BMP deletion significantly increased the numbers of chromogranin A-, ghrelin-, somatostatin-, gastrin-, and serotonin-expressing gastric endocrine cells. Cancer never developed in young adult (<100 days) Bmpr1a-inactivated mice although a marker of spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia was upregulated. Using this model, we have uncovered that BMP signaling negatively regulates the proliferation and commitment of endocrine precursor cells.

To date, unexpectedly high doses of recombinant BMP-2 have been required to induce bone healing in humans. Thus, enhancing cellular responsiveness to BMP-2 potentially has critically important clinical implications. BMP responsiveness may be modulated in part by cross-talk with other signaling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) is a MAPK that has been reported to be required for late-stage differentiation of preosteoblasts and BMP-2-induced differentiation of preosteoblasts and pleuripotent cells. In this study we determined that MC3T3-E1-clone 24 cells (MC-24) can be induced by BMP-2 to differentiate into mineralizing osteoblast cultures. Using this inducible system, we employed both JNK loss-of-function and gain-of-function reagents to make three key observations: (1) JNK is required for phosphorylation of Smad1 by BMP-2 and subsequent activation of Smad1 signaling and osteoblast differentiation, (2) JNK1, but not JNK2, is required for BMP-2-induced formation of mineralized nodules, and (3) JNK1 activation decreases binding of inhibitory Smad6 to the type I BMP receptor (BMPR-I) and reciprocally increases binding of Smad1, both observations that would increase responsiveness to BMP-2. Understanding this and other pathways that lead to increased cellular responsiveness to BMPs could greatly aid more cost-effective and safe clinical delivery of these important molecules.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"21394823","pmcid":null,"title":"Bone morphogenetic protein signaling is required in the dorsal neural folds before neurulation for the induction of spinal neural crest cells and dorsal neurons.","authors":["Stottmann RW","Klingensmith J"],"grantIds":["F31-NS42486","R01-DE13674","R56 DE013674","R56 DE013674-07A1","RC1 NS068932","RC1 NS068932-01","RC1-NS068932"],"grantAgencies":["NINDS NIH HHS","NIDCR NIH HHS","NIDCR NIH HHS","NIDCR NIH HHS","NINDS NIH HHS","NINDS NIH HHS","NINDS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists","journalShort":"Dev.

We found that transcripts encoding several FGF ligands and the four classical FGF receptors are detectable in the lens-forming ectoderm at the time of lens induction. Conditional deletion of Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 from this tissue resulted in the formation of small lens rudiments that soon degenerated. Lens placodes lacking Fgfr1 and 2 were thinner than in wild-type embryos. Deletion of Fgfr2 increased cell death from the initiation of placode formation and concurrent deletion of Fgfr1 enhanced this phenotype. Fgfr1/2 conditional knockout placode cells expressed lower levels of proteins known to be regulated by FGF receptor signaling, but proteins known to be important for lens formation were present at normal levels in the remaining placode cells, including the transcription factors Pax6, Sox2 and FoxE3 and the lens-preferred protein αA-crystallin. Previous studies identified a genetic interaction between BMP and FGF signaling in lens formation and conditional deletion of Bmpr1a caused increased cell death in the lens placode, resulting in the formation of smaller lenses. In the present study, conditional deletion of both Bmpr1a and Fgfr2 increased cell death beyond that seen in Fgfr2(CKO) placodes and prevented lens formation. These results suggest that the primary role of autocrine or paracrine FGF signaling is to provide essential survival signals to lens placode cells. Because apoptosis was already increased at the onset of placode formation in Fgfr1/2 conditional knockout placode cells, FGF signaling was functionally absent during the period of lens induction by the optic vesicle. Since the expression of proteins required for lens formation was not altered in the knockout placode cells, we can conclude that FGF signaling from the optic vesicle is not required for lens induction.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"22485132","pmcid":"3317656","title":"Fstl1 antagonizes BMP signaling and regulates ureter development.","authors":["Xu J","Qi X","Gong J","Yu M","Zhang F","Sha H","Gao X"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"PloS one","journalShort":"PLoS ONE","day":9,"month":4,"year":2012,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors, Type I","Bone Morphogenetic Proteins","Cell Differentiation","Cell Proliferation","Epithelial Cells","Female","Follistatin-Related Proteins","Gene Expression","HEK293 Cells","Hedgehog Proteins","Humans","Male","Mice","Mice, 129 Strain","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Mice, Knockout","Signal Transduction","Ureter","Urinary Tract"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway plays important roles in urinary tract development although the detailed regulation of its activity in this process remains unclear.

Conversely, chronic inflammatory conditions and neoplastic diseases can induce high hepcidin levels, leading to impaired mobilization of iron stores and the anemia of chronic disease. Two BMP type I receptors, Alk2 (Acvr1) and Alk3 (Bmpr1a), are expressed in murine hepatocytes. We report that liver-specific deletion of either Alk2 or Alk3 causes iron overload in mice.

Both Alk2 and Alk3 were required for induction of hepcidin gene expression by BMP2 in cultured hepatocytes or by iron challenge in vivo.

Intracellular signaling is transduced by BMP receptors (BMPRs) of type I and type II that are serine/threonine kinase receptors. The BMP type I a receptor (BMPRIa) is linked to osteogenesis and bone mineral density (BMD). BMPRs are localized to caveolae enriched with Caveolin1 alpha/beta and Caveolin beta isoforms to facilitate signaling.

Less is known about repulsive signal contribution to shaping vessels. Recently, \"neuronal guidance cues\" have been shown to influence EC behavior, particularly in directing sprouting angiogenesis by repelling ECs. However, their role during de novo blood vessel formation remains unexplored. OBJECTIVE: To identify signals that guide and pattern the first mammalian blood vessels. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using genetic mouse models, we show that blood vessels are sculpted through the generation of stereotyped avascular zones by EC-repulsive cues. We demonstrate that Semaphorin3E (Sema3E) is a key factor that shapes the paired dorsal aortae in mouse, as sema3E(-/-) embryos develop an abnormally branched aortic plexus with a markedly narrowed avascular midline. In vitro cultures and avian grafting experiments show strong repulsion of ECs by Sema3E-expressing cells. We further identify the mouse notochord as a rich source of multiple redundant neuronal guidance cues. Mouse embryos that lack notochords fail to form cohesive aortic vessels because of loss of the avascular midline, yet maintain lateral avascular zones. We demonstrate that lateral avascular zones are directly generated by the lateral plate mesoderm, a critical source of Sema3E. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that Sema3E-generated avascular zones are critical regulators of mammalian cardiovascular patterning and are the first to identify a repulsive role for the lateral plate mesoderm. Integration of multiple, and in some cases redundant, repulsive cues from various tissues is critical to patterning the first embryonic blood vessels.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"22306733","pmcid":"3998727","title":"Activin-like kinase 3 is important for kidney regeneration and reversal of fibrosis.","authors":["Sugimoto H","LeBleu VS","Bosukonda D","Keck P","Taduri G","Bechtel W","Okada H","Carlson W","Bey P","Rusckowski M","Tampe B","Tampe D","Kanasaki K","Zeisberg M","Kalluri R"],"grantIds":["2T32DK007760-11","5T32HL007374-30","CA125550","CA151925","CA155370","CA163191","DK061688","DK074558","DK081576","DK55001","U54 CA163191"],"grantAgencies":["NIDDK NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Nature medicine","journalShort":"Nat.

A structure-function analysis of the BMP-Alk3-BMP receptor, type 2 (BMPR2) ligand-receptor complex, along with synthetic organic chemistry, led us to construct a library of small peptide agonists of BMP signaling that function through the Alk3 receptor. One such peptide agonist, THR-123, suppressed inflammation, apoptosis and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition program and reversed established fibrosis in five mouse models of acute and chronic renal injury.

Therapies to prevent bone loss exist, but there are few that stimulate bone formation and restore bone mass. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the TGFβ superfamily, which act as pleiotropic regulators of skeletal organogenesis and bone homeostasis. Ablation of the BMPR1A receptor in osteoblasts increases bone mass, suggesting that inhibition of BMPR1A signaling may have therapeutic benefit. The aim of this study was to determine the skeletal effects of systemic administration of a soluble BMPR1A fusion protein (mBMPR1A-mFc) in vivo. mBMPR1A-mFc was shown to bind BMP2/4 specifically and with high affinity and prevent downstream signaling. mBMPR1A-mFc treatment of immature and mature mice increased bone mineral density, cortical thickness, trabecular bone volume, thickness and number, and decreased trabecular separation. The increase in bone mass was due to an early increase in osteoblast number and bone formation rate, mediated by a suppression of Dickkopf-1 expression. This was followed by a decrease in osteoclast number and eroded surface, which was associated with a decrease in receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) production, an increase in osteoprotegerin expression, and a decrease in serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP5b) concentration. mBMPR1A treatment also increased bone mass and strength in mice with bone loss due to estrogen deficiency. In conclusion, mBMPR1A-mFc stimulates osteoblastic bone formation and decreases bone resorption, which leads to an increase in bone mass, and offers a promising unique alternative for the treatment of bone-related disorders.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"22560297","pmcid":null,"title":"Congenital asplenia in mice and humans with mutations in a Pbx/Nkx2-5/p15 module.","authors":["Koss M","Bolze A","Brendolan A","Saggese M","Capellini TD","Bojilova E","Boisson B","Prall OW","Elliott DA","Solloway M","Lenti E","Hidaka C","Chang CP","Mahlaoui N","Harvey RP","Casanova JL","Selleri L"],"grantIds":["DE18031","HD061403","HD43997","HL085345","R01 HD061403","R01 HD061403-03","UL1RR024143"],"grantAgencies":["NIDCR NIH HHS","NICHD NIH HHS","NICHD NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NICHD NIH HHS","NICHD NIH HHS","NCRR NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Developmental cell","journalShort":"Dev.

BMPs regulate the biology of stem and progenitor cells and can promote cellular differentiation, depending on the cell type and context. Although the BMP pathway is known to be involved in early embryonic development of the mammary gland via mesenchymal cells, its role in later epithelial cellular differentiation has not been examined. The majority of the mammary gland development occurs post-natal, and its final functional differentiation is characterized by the emergence of alveolar cells that produce milk proteins. Here, we tested the hypothesis that bone morphogenetic protein receptor 1A (BMPR1A) function was required for mammary epithelial cell differentiation. We found that the BMPR1A-SMAD1/5/8 pathway was predominantly active in undifferentiated mammary epithelial cells, compared with differentiated cells. Reduction of BMPR1A mRNA and protein, using short hairpin RNA, resulted in a reduction of SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation in undifferentiated cells, indicating an impact on this pathway. When the expression of the BMPR1A gene knocked down in undifferentiated cells, this also prevented beta-casein production during differentiation of the mammary epithelial cells by lactogenic hormone stimulation. Addition of Noggin, a BMP antagonist, also prevented beta-casein expression. Together, this demonstrated that BMP-BMPR1A-SMAD1/5/8 signal transduction is required for beta-casein production, a marker of alveolar cell differentiation.

Such diseases present a number of developmental anomalies such as hydroureter and hydronephrosis. Although some genetically-modified mouse models of growth factor signaling genes reproduce urinary phenotypes, the pathogenic mechanisms remain obscure. Previous studies suggest that a portion of the cells in the external genitalia and bladder are derived from peri-cloacal mesenchymal cells that receive Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in the early developmental stages. We hypothesized that defects in such progenitor cells, which give rise to urinary tract tissues, may be a cause of such diseases. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of upper urinary tract malformations, we analyzed a series of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) deficient mice. Shh(-/-) displayed hydroureter and hydronephrosis phenotypes and reduced expression of several developmental markers. In addition, we suggested that Shh modulation at an early embryonic stage is responsible for such phenotypes by analyzing the Shh conditional mutants. Tissue contribution assays of Hh-responsive cells revealed that peri-cloacal mesenchymal cells, which received Hh signal secreted from cloacal epithelium, could contribute to the ureteral mesenchyme. Gain- and loss-of-functional mutants for Hh signaling revealed a correlation between Hh signaling and Bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) signaling. Finally, a conditional ablation of Bmp receptor type IA (BmprIA) gene was examined in Hh-responsive cell lineages. This system thus made it possible to analyze the primary functions of the growth factor signaling relay. The defective Hh-to-Bmp signaling relay resulted in severe urinary tract phenotypes with a decrease in the number of Hh-responsive cells. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study identified the essential embryonic stages for the pathogenesis of urinary tract phenotypes. These results suggested that Hh-responsive mesenchymal Bmp signaling maintains the population of peri-cloacal mesenchyme cells, which is essential for the development of the ureter and the upper urinary tract.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"24098149","pmcid":"3789827","title":"A GDF5 point mutation strikes twice--causing BDA1 and SYNS2.","authors":["Degenkolbe E","König J","Zimmer J","Walther M","Reißner C","Nickel J","Plöger F","Raspopovic J","Sharpe J","Dathe K","Hecht JT","Mundlos S","Doelken SC","Seemann P"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"PLoS genetics","journalShort":"PLoS Genet.","day":7,"month":10,"year":2013,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors, Type I","Bone Morphogenetic Proteins","Brachydactyly","Chickens","Growth Differentiation Factor 5","Humans","Mice","Osteoarthritis","Pedigree","Point Mutation","Protein Binding","Signal Transduction","Synostosis"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Growth and Differentiation Factor 5 (GDF5) is a secreted growth factor that belongs to the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) family and plays a pivotal role during limb development.

Here, we report on a family with an autosomal dominant inherited combination of SYNS2 and additional brachydactyly type A1 (BDA1) caused by a single point mutation in GDF5 (p.W414R). Functional studies, including chondrogenesis assays with primary mesenchymal cells, luciferase reporter gene assays and Surface Plasmon Resonance analysis, of the GDF5(W414R) variant in comparison to other GDF5 mutations associated with isolated BDA1 (p.R399C) or SYNS2 (p.E491K) revealed a dual pathomechanism characterized by a gain- and loss-of-function at the same time. On the one hand insensitivity to the main GDF5 antagonist NOGGIN (NOG) leads to a GDF5 gain of function and subsequent SYNS2 phenotype. Whereas on the other hand, a reduced signaling activity, specifically via the BMP receptor type IA (BMPR1A), is likely responsible for the BDA1 phenotype. These results demonstrate that one mutation in the overlapping interface of antagonist and receptor binding site in GDF5 can lead to a GDF5 variant with pathophysiological relevance for both, BDA1 and SYNS2 development.

These novel insights into the biology of GDF5 might also provide further clues on the pathophysiology of OA.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"23676271","pmcid":null,"title":"Notch2 regulates BMP signaling and epithelial morphogenesis in the ciliary body of the mouse eye.","authors":["Zhou Y","Tanzie C","Yan Z","Chen S","Duncan M","Gaudenz K","Li H","Seidel C","Lewis B","Moran A","Libby RT","Kiernan AE","Xie T"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","journalShort":"Proc.

It contains a folded two-layered epithelial structure comprising the nonpigmented inner ciliary epithelium (ICE), the pigmented outer ciliary epithelium (OCE), and the underlying stroma. Although the CB has an important function in the eye, its morphogenesis remains poorly studied. In this study, we show that conditional inactivation of the Jagged 1 (Jag1)-Notch2 signaling pathway in the developing CB abolishes its morphogenesis. Notch2 is expressed in the OCE of the CB, whereas Jag1 is expressed in the ICE. Conditional inactivation of Jag1 in the ICE or Notch2 in the OCE disrupts CB morphogenesis, but neither affects the specification of the CB region. Notch2 signaling in the OCE is required for promoting cell proliferation and maintaining bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, both of which have been suggested to be important for CB morphogenesis. Although Notch and BMP signaling pathways are known to cross-talk via the interaction between their downstream transcriptional factors, this study suggests that Notch2 maintains BMP signaling in the OCE possibly by repressing expression of secreted BMP inhibitors. Based on our findings, we propose that Jag1-Notch2 signaling controls CB morphogenesis at least in part by regulating cell proliferation and BMP signaling.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"23584254","pmcid":null,"title":"Expression of the BMP receptor Alk3 in the second heart field is essential for development of the dorsal mesenchymal protrusion and atrioventricular septation.","authors":["Briggs LE","Phelps AL","Brown E","Kakarla J","Anderson RH","van den Hoff MJ","Wessels A"],"grantIds":["5T32-GM008716-12","C06 RR015455","C06 RR018823","C06-RR018823","CO0-RR015455","P30 GM103342","P30 GM103342-01","R01 HL033756","R01 HL084285","R01HL084285","R25 HL092611","T32 GM008716","UL1 RR029882","UL1 TR000062","UL1RR029882","UL1TR000062"],"grantAgencies":["NIGMS NIH HHS","NCRR NIH HHS","NCRR NIH HHS","NCRR NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NIGMS NIH HHS","NIGMS NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NIGMS NIH HHS","NCRR NIH HHS","NCATS NIH HHS","NCRR NIH HHS","NCATS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Circulation research","journalShort":"Circ.

Recent studies have shown that perturbation of its development is associated with the pathogenesis of atrioventricular (AV) septal defect. Although the importance of the DMP to AV septation is now established, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying its development are far from fully understood. Prior studies have demonstrated that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling is essential for proper formation of the AV endocardial cushions and the cardiac outflow tract. A role for BMP signaling in regulation of DMP development remained to be elucidated. OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of BMP signaling in DMP development. METHODS AND RESULTS: Conditional deletion of the BMP receptor Alk3 from venous pole SHF cells leads to impaired formation of the DMP and a completely penetrant phenotype of ostium primum defect, a hallmark feature of AV septal defects. Analysis of mutants revealed decreased proliferative index of SHF cells and, consequently, reduced number of SHF cells at the cardiac venous pole. In contrast, volume and expression of markers associated with proliferation and active BMP/transforming growth factor β signaling were not significantly altered in the AV cushions of SHF-Alk3 mutants. CONCLUSIONS: BMP signaling is required for expansion of the SHF-derived DMP progenitor population at the cardiac venous pole. Perturbation of Alk3-mediated BMP signaling from the SHF results in impaired development of the DMP and ostium primum defects.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"23560082","pmcid":"3613384","title":"Endocardial to myocardial notch-wnt-bmp axis regulates early heart valve development.","authors":["Wang Y","Wu B","Chamberlain AA","Lui W","Koirala P","Susztak K","Klein D","Taylor V","Zhou B"],"grantIds":["R01 DK076077","R01DK076077","R01HL078881","R01HL111770","T32 GM007288"],"grantAgencies":["NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NIGMS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"PloS one","journalShort":"PLoS ONE","day":5,"month":4,"year":2013,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2","Calcium-Binding Proteins","Embryo, Mammalian","Endocardium","Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition","Extracellular Matrix Proteins","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Heart Valves","Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins","Membrane Proteins","Mice","Mice, Transgenic","Myocardium","Organogenesis","Receptor, Notch1","Signal Transduction","Wnt4 Protein"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Endocardial to mesenchymal transformation (EMT) is a fundamental cellular process required for heart valve formation.

We show that lungs of Tbx2-deficient mice are markedly hypoplastic and exhibit reduced branching morphogenesis. Mesenchymal proliferation was severely decreased, while mesenchymal differentiation into fibrocytes was prematurely induced. In the epithelial compartment, proliferation was reduced and differentiation of alveolar epithelial cells type 1 was compromised. Prior to the observed cellular changes, canonical Wnt signaling was downregulated, and Cdkn1a (p21) and Cdkn1b (p27) (two members of the Cip/Kip family of cell cycle inhibitors) were strongly induced in the Tbx2-deficient lung mesenchyme. Deletion of both Cdkn1a and Cdkn1b rescued, to a large degree, the growth deficits of Tbx2-deficient lungs. Prolongation of Tbx2 expression into adulthood led to hyperproliferation and maintenance of mesenchymal progenitor cells, with branching morphogenesis remaining unaffected. Expression of Cdkn1a and Cdkn1b was ablated from the lung mesenchyme in this gain-of-function setting. We further show by ChIP experiments that Tbx2 directly binds to Cdkn1a and Cdkn1b loci in vivo, defining these two genes as direct targets of Tbx2 repressive activity in the lung mesenchyme. We conclude that Tbx2-mediated regulation of Cdkn1a and Cdkn1b represents a crucial node in the network integrating patterning information and cell cycle regulation that underlies growth, differentiation, and branching morphogenesis of this organ.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"24657641","pmcid":null,"title":"FGFR3 induces degradation of BMP type I receptor to regulate skeletal development.","authors":["Qi H","Jin M","Duan Y","Du X","Zhang Y","Ren F","Wang Y","Tian Q","Wang X","Wang Q","Zhu Y","Xie Y","Liu C","Cao X","Mishina Y","Chen D","Deng CX","Chang Z","Chen L"],"grantIds":["P30 DK079637","R01 AR054465","R01 AR055915"],"grantAgencies":["NIDDK NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Biochimica et biophysica acta","journalShort":"Biochim.

In this study, we found that chondrocyte-specific deletion of BMP type I receptor a (Bmpr1a) rescued the bone overgrowth phenotype observed in Fgfr3 deficient mice by reducing chondrocyte differentiation.

We found that FGFR3 facilitates BMPR1a to degradation through Smurf1-mediated ubiquitination pathway. We demonstrated that down-regulation of BMP signaling by BMPR1 inhibitor dorsomorphin led to the retardation of chondrogenic differentiation, which mimics the effect of FGF-2 on chondrocytes and BMP-2 treatment partially rescued the retarded growth of cultured bone rudiments from thanatophoric dysplasia type II mice.

Mice bearing enhanced BMPRIa-mediated signaling in CNC cells exhibit complete cleft palate and delayed odontogenic differentiation. We showed that the cleft palate defect in the transgenic animals is attributed to an altered cell proliferation rate in the anterior palatal mesenchyme and to the delayed palatal elevation in the posterior portion associated with ectopic cartilage formation. Despite enhanced activity of BMP signaling in the dental mesenchyme, tooth development and patterning in transgenic mice appeared normal except delayed odontogenic differentiation.

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a specialized fat tissue that is dedicated to thermoregulation. Owing to its remarkable capacity to dissipate stored energy and its demonstrated presence in adult humans, BAT holds great promise for the treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Rodent data suggest the existence of two types of brown fat cells: constitutive BAT (cBAT), which is of embryonic origin and anatomically located in the interscapular region of mice; and recruitable BAT (rBAT), which resides within white adipose tissue (WAT) and skeletal muscle, and has alternatively been called beige, brite or inducible BAT. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) regulate the formation and thermogenic activity of BAT. Here we use mouse models to provide evidence for a systemically active regulatory mechanism that controls whole-body BAT activity for thermoregulation and energy homeostasis. Genetic ablation of the type 1A BMP receptor (Bmpr1a) in brown adipogenic progenitor cells leads to a severe paucity of cBAT. This in turn increases sympathetic input to WAT, thereby promoting the formation of rBAT within white fat depots. This previously unknown compensatory mechanism, aimed at restoring total brown-fat-mediated thermogenic capacity in the body, is sufficient to maintain normal temperature homeostasis and resistance to diet-induced obesity. These data suggest an important physiological cross-talk between constitutive and recruitable brown fat cells.

The expression of β-catenin is observed in endodermal epithelia, including URS epithelia. We modulated the β-catenin gene conditionally in endodermal epithelia by utilizing tamoxifen-inducible Cre driver line (Shh(CreERT2)). Both β-catenin loss- and gain-of-function (LOF and GOF) mutants displayed abnormal clefts in the perineal region and hypoplastic elongation of the URS.

This instability possibly resulted in reduced expression levels of differentiation markers, such as keratin 1 and filaggrin, in the perineal epithelia.

Its synthesis by pituitary gonadotrope cells is regulated by multiple endocrine and paracrine factors, including TGFβ superfamily ligands, such as the activins and inhibins. Activins stimulate FSH synthesis via transcriptional regulation of its β-subunit gene (Fshb). More recently, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) were shown to stimulate murine Fshb transcription alone and in synergy with activins. BMP2 signals via its canonical type I receptor, BMPR1A (or activin receptor-like kinase 3 [ALK3]), and SMAD1 and SMAD5 to stimulate transcription of inhibitor of DNA binding proteins. Inhibitor of DNA binding proteins then potentiate the actions of activin-stimulated SMAD3 to regulate the Fshb gene in the gonadotrope-like LβT2 cell line. Here, we report the unexpected observation that BMP2 also stimulates the SMAD2/3 pathway in these cells and that it does so directly via ALK3. Indeed, this novel, noncanonical ALK3 activity is completely independent of ALK4, ALK5, and ALK7, the type I receptors most often associated with SMAD2/3 pathway activation. Induction of the SMAD2/3 pathway by ALK3 is dependent upon its own previous activation by associated type II receptors, which phosphorylate conserved serine and threonine residues in the ALK3 juxtamembrane glycine-serine-rich domain. ALK3 signaling via SMAD3 is necessary for the receptor to stimulate Fshb transcription, whereas its activation of the SMAD1/5/8 pathway alone is insufficient. These data challenge current dogma that ALK3 and other BMP type I receptors signal via SMAD1, SMAD5, and SMAD8 and not SMAD2 or SMAD3.

While a number of factors have been implicated in the degeneration and resorption processes, signaling pathways that trigger this degradation are currently unknown. BMP signaling has been implicated in almost every step of chondrogenesis. In this study, we used Noggin mutant mice as a model for gain-of-BMP signaling function to investigate the function of BMP signaling in Meckel's cartilage development, with a focus on the middle portion. We showed that Bmp2 and Bmp7 are expressed in early developing Meckels' cartilage, but their expression disappears thereafter. In contrast, Noggin is expressed constantly in Meckel's cartilage throughout the entire gestation period. In the absence of Noggin, Meckel's cartilage is significantly thickened attributing to dramatically elevated cell proliferation rate associated with enhanced phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 expression. Interestingly, instead of taking a degeneration fate, the middle portion of Meckel's cartilage in Noggin mutants undergoes chondrogenic differentiation and endochondral ossification contributing to the forming mandible. Chondrocyte-specific expression of a constitutively active form of BMPRIa but not BMPRIb leads to enlargement of Meckel's cartilage, phenocopying the consequence of Noggin deficiency. Our results demonstrate that elevated BMP signaling prevents degeneration and leads to endochondral ossification of Meckel's cartilage, and support the idea that withdrawal of BMP signaling is required for normal Meckel's cartilage development and ultimate cell fate.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"24048844","pmcid":null,"title":"Dendrite complexity of sympathetic neurons is controlled during postnatal development by BMP signaling.","authors":["Majdazari A","Stubbusch J","Müller CM","Hennchen M","Weber M","Deng CX","Mishina Y","Schütz G","Deller T","Rohrer H"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","journalShort":"J.

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) stimulate dendrite growth in cultures of sympathetic, cortical, and hippocampal neurons but it was unclear whether BMPs control dendrite morphology in vivo. Using a conditional knock-out strategy to eliminate Bmpr1a and Smad4 in immature noradrenergic sympathetic neurons we now show that dendrite length, complexity, and neuron cell body size are reduced in adult mice deficient of Bmpr1a. The combined deletion of Bmpr1a and Bmpr1b causes no further decrease in dendritic features. Sympathetic neurons devoid of Bmpr1a/1b display normal Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation, which suggests that Smad-independent signaling paths are involved in dendritic growth control downstream of BMPR1A/B. Indeed, in the Smad4 conditional knock-out dendrite and cell body size are not affected and dendrite complexity and number are increased. Together, these results demonstrate an in vivo function for BMPs in the generation of mature sympathetic neuron dendrites. BMPR1 signaling controls dendrite complexity postnatally during the major dendritic growth period of sympathetic neurons.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"24081330","pmcid":null,"title":"Cessation of epithelial Bmp signaling switches the differentiation of crown epithelia to the root lineage in a β-catenin-dependent manner.","authors":["Yang Z","Hai B","Qin L","Ti X","Shangguan L","Zhao Y","Wiggins L","Liu Y","Feng JQ","Chang JY","Wang F","Liu F"],"grantIds":["K08 DE020883","R01 CA096824","R56 DE023106","T32 DE018380"],"grantAgencies":["NIDCR NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NIDCR NIH HHS","NIDCR NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Molecular and cellular biology","journalShort":"Mol.

Bmp signaling has been linked to enamel formation, but its role in root epithelial lineage differentiation is unclear. Here we show that cessation of epithelial Bmp signaling by Bmpr1a depletion during the differentiation stage switched differentiation of crown epithelia into the root lineage and led to formation of ectopic cementum-like structures. This phenotype is related to the upregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Although epithelial β-catenin depletion during the differentiation stage also led to variable enamel defect and precocious/ectopic formation of fragmented root epithelia in some teeth, it did not cause ectopic cementogenesis and inhibited EMT in cultured dental epithelia. Concomitant epithelial β-catenin depletion rescued EMT and ectopic cementogenesis caused by Bmpr1a depletion. These data suggested that Bmp and Wnt/β-catenin pathways interact antagonistically in dental epithelia to regulate the root lineage differentiation and EMT. These findings will aid in the design of new strategies to promote functional differentiation in the regeneration and tissue engineering of teeth and will provide new insights into the dynamic interactions between the Bmp and Wnt/β-catenin pathways during cell fate decisions.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"24398041","pmcid":null,"title":"Expression of bone morphogenetic protein 4 and its receptors in the remodeling heart.","authors":["Wu X","Sagave J","Rutkovskiy A","Haugen F","Baysa A","Nygård S","Czibik G","Dahl CP","Gullestad L","Vaage J","Valen G"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Life sciences","journalShort":"Life Sci.","day":3,"month":3,"year":2014,"meshHeadings":["Adult","Aged","Animals","Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4","Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors, Type I","Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors, Type II","Cardiomyopathy, Dilated","Coronary Artery Disease","Disease Models, Animal","Down-Regulation","Female","Heart Failure","Humans","Male","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Middle Aged","Myocardial Infarction","Myocardial Ischemia","Myocytes, Cardiac","RNA, Messenger","Time Factors","Ventricular Remodeling","Young Adult"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"AIMS: Heart failure is associated with activation of fetal gene programs. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) regulate embryonic development through interaction with BMP receptors (BMPRs) on the cell surface. We investigated if the expression of BMP4 and its receptors BMPR1a and BMPR2 were activated in post-infarction remodeling and heart failure. MAIN METHODS: Left ventricular biopsies were taken from explanted hearts of patients with end-stage heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy (CMP; n=15) or ischemic heart disease (CAD; n=9), and compared with homograft control preparations from organ donors deceased due to non-cardiac causes (n=7). Other samples were taken from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG; n=11). Mice were subjected to induced infarction by permanent coronary artery ligation or sham operation, and hearts were sampled serially thereafter (n=7 at each time point). KEY FINDINGS: Human and mouse hearts expressed BMP4 and both receptor subtypes. CABG and CMP patients had increased expression of mRNA encoding for BMP4, but unchanged protein. Mouse hearts had increased BMP4 precursor protein 24h after infarction. BMPR1a protein decreased in CAD patients and initially in postinfarcted mouse hearts, but increased again in the latter after two weeks. Human recombinant BMP4 promoted survival after H2O2 injury in HL-1 cells, and also protected adult mouse cardiomyocytes against hypoxia-reoxygenation injury. SIGNIFICANCE: Adult hearts express BMP4, the mRNA increasingly so in patients with coronary artery disease with good cardiac function. BMPRs are downregulated in cardiac remodeling and failure. Recombinant BMP4 has protective effects on cultured cardiomyocytes.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"23712751","pmcid":null,"title":"Expression levels of endoglin distinctively identify hematopoietic and endothelial progeny at different stages of yolk sac hematopoiesis.","authors":["Borges L","Iacovino M","Koyano-Nakagawa N","Baik J","Garry DJ","Kyba M","Perlingeiro RC"],"grantIds":["R01 HL085840","R01 HL085840-01","T32 AR007612","U01 HL100407","U01 HL100407"],"grantAgencies":["NHLBI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)","journalShort":"Stem Cells","day":7,"month":9,"year":2013,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Bone Morphogenetic Proteins","Endothelial Cells","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Hematopoiesis","Hematopoietic Stem Cells","Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins","Mice","Models, Biological","Signal Transduction","Subcellular Fractions","Transforming Growth Factor beta","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2","Yolk Sac"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Endoglin (Eng), an ancillary receptor of the transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signaling pathway superfamily, has been well recognized for its important function in vascular development and angiogenesis since its discovery more than a decade ago. Recent studies show that this receptor is also critical for the emergence of blood during embryonic development, and that at E7.5, endoglin together with Flk-1 identifies early mesoderm progenitors that are endowed with hematopoietic and endothelial potential. These two lineages emerge in very close association during embryogenesis, and because they share the expression of the same surface markers, it has been difficult to distinguish the earliest hematopoietic from endothelial cells. Here, we evaluated the function of endoglin in hematopoiesis as development progresses past E7.5, and found that the hematopoietic and endothelial progenitors can be distinguished by the levels of endoglin in E9.5 yolk sacs. Whereas endothelial cells are Eng(bright), hematopoietic activity is primarily restricted to a subset of cells that display dim expression of endoglin (Eng(dim)). Molecular characterization of these subfractions showed that endoglin-mediated induction of hematopoiesis occurs in concert with BMP2/BMP4 signaling. This pathway is highly active in Eng(dim) cells but significantly downregulated in the Eng knockout. Taken together, our findings show an important function for endoglin in mediating BMP2/BMP4 signaling during yolk sac hematopoietic development and suggest that the levels of this receptor modulate TGFβ versus bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"24491691","pmcid":null,"title":"Jagged1 is essential for osteoblast development during maxillary ossification.","authors":["Hill CR","Yuasa M","Schoenecker J","Goudy SL"],"grantIds":["5K08DE17953-5","K08 DE017953","S10 RR027631"],"grantAgencies":["NIDCR NIH HHS","NIDCR NIH HHS","NCRR NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Bone","journalShort":"Bone","day":17,"month":5,"year":2014,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Bone Density","Bone Morphogenetic Proteins","Calcification, Physiologic","Calcium","Calcium-Binding Proteins","Cell Differentiation","Embryo, Mammalian","Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins","Maxilla","Membrane Proteins","Mesoderm","Mice, Knockout","Organ Size","Osteoblasts","Osteogenesis","Palate","Receptors, Fc","Receptors, Notch","Signal Transduction","X-Ray Microtomography"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Maxillary hypoplasia occurs due to insufficient maxillary intramembranous ossification, leading to poor dental occlusion, respiratory obstruction and cosmetic deformities.

We found that homozygous mutant mice died during gastrulation, whereas heterozygous mice grew normally without developing pulmonary arterial hypertension. Using pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PaSMC) from heterozygous mice, we determined that the mutant receptor was expressed and retained its ability to transduce BMP signaling. Heterozygous PaSMCs exhibited a BMP7‑specific gain of function, which was transduced via the mutant receptor. Using siRNA knockdown and cells from conditional knockout mice to selectively deplete BMP receptors, we observed that the tail domain of Bmpr2 inhibits Alk2‑mediated BMP7 signaling.

Using mice with hepatocyte-specific deficiency of Alk2 or Alk3, we sought to identify the BMP type I receptor that participates in IL-6-mediated induction of hepcidin gene expression. Mice were injected with adenovirus specifying IL-6 (Ad.IL-6) or control adenovirus.
