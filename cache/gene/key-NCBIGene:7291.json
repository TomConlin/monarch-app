The protein encoded by this gene is a bHLH transcription factor and shares similarity with another bHLH transcription factor, Dermo1. The strongest expression of this mRNA is in placental tissue; in adults, mesodermally derived tissues express this mRNA preferentially.

Twist possesses an oncogenic function by interfering with the tumor suppressor function of p53. Using a membrane pull-down assay, we found that Twist directly interacts with p53 and that this interaction underlies the inhibitory effects on p53 target gene expression. Twist interacted with the DNA-binding domain of p53 and suppressed the DNA-binding activity of p53. Transcriptional activation of the p21 promoter by p53 was significantly repressed by the expression of Twist. On the other hand, p53 interacted with the N-terminal domain of Twist and repressed Twist-dependent YB-1 promoter activity. Importantly, we found that p53-dependent growth suppression was canceled by the expression of either Twist or YB-1. Thus, our data suggest that Twist inhibits p53 function via a direct interaction with p53.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"25402006","pmcid":null,"title":"In silico prediction of physical protein interactions and characterization of interactome orphans.","authors":["Kotlyar M","Pastrello C","Pivetta F","Lo Sardo A","Cumbaa C","Li H","Naranian T","Niu Y","Ding Z","Vafaee F","Broackes-Carter F","Petschnigg J","Mills GB","Jurisicova A","Stagljar I","Maestro R","Jurisica I"],"grantIds":["#93579","#99745","01CA0099031","NCI R21 CA126700","NHG99091","PPP-125785","R01 HG001715"],"grantAgencies":["Canadian Institutes of Health Research","Canadian Institutes of Health Research","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","Canadian Institutes of Health Research","Canadian Institutes of Health Research","NHGRI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Nature methods","journalShort":"Nat.

At an estimated false discovery rate of 60%, we predicted 250,498 PPIs among 10,531 human proteins; 10,647 PPIs involved 1,089 proteins without known interactions. We experimentally tested 233 high- and medium-confidence predictions and validated 137 interactions, including seven novel putative interactors of the tumor suppressor p53. Compared to previous PPI prediction methods, FpClass achieved better agreement with experimentally detected PPIs.

Here we combined proteomic and genomic approaches to characterize gene regulation by Sox2 in neural stem cells. Chd7, a chromatin remodeling ATPase associated with CHARGE syndrome, was identified as a Sox2 transcriptional cofactor.

Advances in mass spectrometry and the development of antibodies recognizing the Lys-ϵ-Gly-Gly (diGly) remnant from ubiquitinated proteins following trypsinolysis have provided a tool to address this question. We implemented an inducible loss of function approach in combination with quantitative diGly proteomics to find novel substrates of HUWE1 (HECT, UBA, and WWE domain containing 1, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase), an E3 ligase implicated in cancer and intellectual disabilities. diGly proteomics results led to the identification of DNA damage-inducible transcript 4 (DDIT4) as a putative HUWE1 substrate.

Twist1 and Mastermind-like 1 (MAML1) are major regulators of EMT through different pathways. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathological relevance of the expression of MAML-1 and Twist1 genes in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). METHODS: Tumoral and corresponding normal tissues from 55 treatment-naive ESCC patients were subjected for expression analysis with quantitative real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Overexpression of MAML-1 and Twist1 were significantly associated with lymph node metastasis and the surgical staging of tumor. Overexpression of Twist1 was associated with tumor depth of invasion. Mean relative expression (MRE) of MAML1 was significantly higher in patients with metastasis to lymph nodes (3.07 ± 0.51 vs. 0.86 ± 0.58, P = .008). MRE of Twist1 was significantly higher in patients with invasion of tumor to adventitia (T3, T4) (1.97 ± 0.29 vs. 0.39 ± 0.73, P = .036).

However, the molecular and functional regulatory relationship between TWIST and ERα are unclear. In this study, we found TWIST was associated with a chromatin region in intron 7 of the human ESR1 gene coding for ERα. This association of TWIST efficiently recruited the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) repressor complex to this region, which subsequently decreased histone H3K9 acetylation, increased histone H3K9 methylation and repressed ESR1 expression in breast cancer cells. In agreement with these molecular events, TWIST expression was inversely correlated with ERα expression in both breast cancer cell lines and human breast ductal carcinomas. Forced expression of TWIST in TWIST-negative and ERα-positive breast cancer cells such as T47D and MCF-7 cells reduced ERα expression, while knockdown of TWIST in TWIST-positive and ERα-negative breast cancer cells such as MDA-MB-435 and 4T1 cells increased ERα expression. Furthermore, inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity including the one in NuRD complex significantly increased ERα expression in MDA-MB-435 and 4T1 cells. HDAC inhibition together with TWIST knockdown did not further increase ERα expression in 4T1 and MDA-MB-435 cells. These results demonstrate that TWIST/NuRD represses ERα expression in breast cancer cells. Therefore, TWIST may serve as a potential molecular target for converting ERα-negative breast cancers to ERα-positive breast cancers, allowing these cancers to restore their sensitivity to endocrine therapy with selective ERα antagonists such as tamoxifen and raloxifene.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"23041239","pmcid":"3490334","title":"Genetic risk factors for ischaemic stroke and its subtypes (the METASTROKE collaboration): a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies.","authors":["Traylor M","Farrall M","Holliday EG","Sudlow C","Hopewell JC","Cheng YC","Fornage M","Ikram MA","Malik R","Bevan S","Thorsteinsdottir U","Nalls MA","Longstreth W","Wiggins KL","Yadav S","Parati EA","Destefano AL","Worrall BB","Kittner SJ","Khan MS","Reiner AP","Helgadottir A","Achterberg S","Fernandez-Cadenas I","Abboud S","Schmidt R","Walters M","Chen WM","Ringelstein EB","O'Donnell M","Ho WK","Pera J","Lemmens R","Norrving B","Higgins P","Benn M","Sale M","Kuhlenbäumer G","Doney AS","Vicente AM","Delavaran H","Algra A","Davies G","Oliveira SA","Palmer CN","Deary I","Schmidt H","Pandolfo M","Montaner J","Carty C","de Bakker PI","Kostulas K","Ferro JM","van Zuydam NR","Valdimarsson E","Nordestgaard BG","Lindgren A","Thijs V","Slowik A","Saleheen D","Paré G","Berger K","Thorleifsson G","Australian Stroke Genetics Collaborative, Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 (WTCCC2)","Hofman A","Mosley TH","Mitchell BD","Furie K","Clarke R","Levi C","Seshadri S","Gschwendtner A","Boncoraglio GB","Sharma P","Bis JC","Gretarsdottir S","Psaty BM","Rothwell PM","Rosand J","Meschia JF","Stefansson K","Dichgans M","Markus HS","International Stroke Genetics Consortium"],"grantIds":["090532","095626","BB/F019394/1","G0500987","G0601325","G0700704","MC_U137686857","MR/K026992/1","OSRP2/1006","R01 HL105756","RP-PG-0606-1146"],"grantAgencies":["Wellcome Trust","Wellcome Trust","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council","Medical Research Council","Medical Research Council","Medical Research Council","Medical Research Council","Medical Research Council","The Dunhill Medical Trust","NHLBI NIH HHS","Department of Health","Medical Research Council","Wellcome Trust"],"retractions":[],"journal":"The Lancet.

We established the METASTROKE collaboration with the aim of validating associations from previous GWAS and identifying novel genetic associations through meta-analysis of GWAS datasets for ischaemic stroke and its subtypes. METHODS: We meta-analysed data from 15 ischaemic stroke cohorts with a total of 12 389 individuals with ischaemic stroke and 62 004 controls, all of European ancestry. For the associations reaching genome-wide significance in METASTROKE, we did a further analysis, conditioning on the lead single nucleotide polymorphism in every associated region. Replication of novel suggestive signals was done in 13 347 cases and 29 083 controls. FINDINGS: We verified previous associations for cardioembolic stroke near PITX2 (p=2·8×10(-16)) and ZFHX3 (p=2·28×10(-8)), and for large-vessel stroke at a 9p21 locus (p=3·32×10(-5)) and HDAC9 (p=2·03×10(-12)). Additionally, we verified that all associations were subtype specific. Conditional analysis in the three regions for which the associations reached genome-wide significance (PITX2, ZFHX3, and HDAC9) indicated that all the signal in each region could be attributed to one risk haplotype. We also identified 12 potentially novel loci at p<5×10(-6). However, we were unable to replicate any of these novel associations in the replication cohort. INTERPRETATION: Our results show that, although genetic variants can be detected in patients with ischaemic stroke when compared with controls, all associations we were able to confirm are specific to a stroke subtype. This finding has two implications. First, to maximise success of genetic studies in ischaemic stroke, detailed stroke subtyping is required. Second, different genetic pathophysiological mechanisms seem to be associated with different stroke subtypes.

Many of these target mRNA transcripts are involved in regulating processes commonly altered during tumorigenesis and metastatic growth. These include cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. Among the several miRNAs, miRNA-10b (miR-10b) expression is increased in metastatic breast cancer cells and positively regulates cell migration and invasion through the suppression of the homeobox D10 (HOXD10) tumor suppressor signaling pathway. In breast metastatic cells, miR-10b expression is enhanced by a transcription factor TWIST1. We find that miR-10b expression in breast cancer cells can be suppressed by CCN5, and this CCN5 effect is mediated through the inhibition of TWIST1 expression. Moreover, CCN5-induced inhibition of TWIST1 expression is mediated through the translational inhibition/modification of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α via impeding JNK signaling pathway. Collectively, these studies suggest a novel regulatory pathway exists through which CCN5 exerts its anti-invasive function. On the basis of these findings, it is plausible that reactivation of CCN5 in miR-10b-positive invasive/metastatic breast cancers alone or in combination with current therapeutic regimens could provide a unique, alternative strategy to existing breast cancer therapy.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"21914771","pmcid":null,"title":"Critical role for TWIST1 in the induction of human uterine decidualization.","authors":["Schroeder JK","Kessler CA","Handwerger S"],"grantIds":["HD15201"],"grantAgencies":["NICHD NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Endocrinology","journalShort":"Endocrinology","day":24,"month":11,"year":2011,"meshHeadings":["Apoptosis","Decidua","Dinoprostone","Estradiol","Female","Fibroblasts","Forkhead Transcription Factors","Gene Expression","Humans","Medroxyprogesterone","Nuclear Proteins","Placenta","Pregnancy","Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1","RNA, Small Interfering","Stromal Cells","Twist Transcription Factor"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"The importance of the transcription factor TWIST1 for uterine decidualization was examined in human uterine fibroblast (HUF) cells decidualized in vitro with medroxyprogesterone, estradiol (E2), and prostaglandin E2.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a major mechanism of cancer metastasis, is a process that generates cells with stem cell-like properties (cancer stemness). Cancer stemness is a concept that describes a minor population of cells (cancer stem cells) residing within a tumour that are able to self-renew and are resistant to conventional therapy. The mechanisms delineating the generation of cancer stemness and its connection to cancer metastasis remain largely unknown. Twist1 is an EMT regulator and increased Twist1 expression, which has prognostic significance in various human cancers, has been widely reported. Bmi1 is a critical component of polycomb repressive complex (PRC) 1, which maintains self-renewal and stemness. Bmi1 is frequently overexpressed in different types of human cancers and can induce drug resistance (Table 2). Recent studies have shown that Twist1 directly activates Bmi1 expression and that these two molecules function together to mediate cancer stemness and EMT. These results present a unique mechanism of EMT-induced cancer metastasis and stemness.

Cell growth ability in vitro was evaluated by MTT and clone formation assays. Xenograft cancer models were established by nude mouse transfer method. Activator protein-1 (AP-1) DNA binding activity was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The expression of c-Jun and c-Fos were examined by Western blotting. The mRNA level of cyclin D1 was detected by RT-PCR. RESULTS: TwistAS inhibited cell growth and proliferation.

In this study, we identified the oncogenic protein, TWIST1 (Twist), which is overexpressed in high-grade breast cancers, as a potential negative regulator of ER expression. Functional characterization of ER regulation by Twist was performed using Twist low (MCF-7, T-47D) and Twist high (Hs 578T, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7/Twist) expressing cell lines. All Twist high expressing cell lines exhibited low ER transcript and protein levels. By chromatin immunoprecipitation and promoter assays, we demonstrated that Twist could directly bind to E-boxes in the ER promoter and significantly downregulate ER promoter activity in vitro. Functionally, Twist overexpression caused estrogen-independent proliferation of breast cells, and promoted hormone resistance to the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen and selective estrogen receptor down-regulator fulvestrant. Importantly, this effect was reversible on downregulating Twist. In addition, orthotopic tumors generated in mice using MCF-7/Twist cells were resistant to tamoxifen. These tumors had high vascular volume and permeability surface area, as determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Mechanistically, Twist recruited DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) to the ER promoter, leading to a significantly higher degree of ER promoter methylation compared with parental cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation that Twist interacted with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) at the ER promoter, causing histone deacetylation and chromatin condensation, further reducing ER transcript levels. Functional re-expression of ER was achieved using the demethylating agent, 5-azacytidine, and the HDAC inhibitor, valproic acid. Finally, an inverse relationship was observed between Twist and ER expression in human breast tumors. In summary, the regulation of ER by Twist could be an underlying mechanism for the loss of ER activity observed in breast tumors, and may contribute to the generation of hormone-resistant, ER-negative breast cancer.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"22006115","pmcid":null,"title":"Temporal and spatial cooperation of Snail1 and Twist1 during epithelial-mesenchymal transition predicts for human breast cancer recurrence.","authors":["Tran DD","Corsa CA","Biswas H","Aft RL","Longmore GD"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Molecular cancer research : MCR","journalShort":"Mol.

Ultimate inducers of EMT are transcriptional repressors that individually can induce experimental EMT, yet in many cells, particularly cancer cells, multiple inducers are expressed simultaneously. Why, and if, and how they interact to regulate EMT is unanswered. Using RNA interference technology to affect protein knockdown and avoid potential overexpression artifact coupled with transient TGFβ treatment to better mimic in vivo conditions we show, in both nontumorigenic and tumorigenic epithelial cancer cells, that Snail1 is uniquely required for EMT initiation, whereas Twist1 is required to maintain late EMT. Twist1, present in resting epithelial cells, is dispensable for EMT initiation. Mechanistically, in response to transient TGFβ treatment, transient Snail1 expression represses Twist1 transcription directly, which is subsequently upregulated, as Snail1 levels decrease, to sustain E-cadherin downregulation and growth arrest of EMT. Persistent Twist1 expression is associated with a p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase signal feedback loop that sustains growth-inhibitory signals characteristic of quiescent micrometastatic tumors. This Snail1-Twist1 temporal and spatial cooperation was also observed in vivo during human breast cancer progression to metastasis. Twist1 level, but not Snail1 level, and Twist1:Snail1 ratio in disseminated micrometastatic bone marrow tumor cells was found to correlate with survival and treatment resistance and is highly predictive of metastatic or recurrent disease.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"22155737","pmcid":null,"title":"Aberrant expression of the transcriptional factor Twist1 promotes invasiveness in ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma.","authors":["Zhang J","Wang P","Wu F","Li M","Sharon D","Ingham RJ","Hitt M","McMullen TP","Lai R"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":["Canadian Institutes of Health Research"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Cellular signalling","journalShort":"Cell.

Using RT-PCR and Western blots, Twist1 was detectable in all 3 ALK+ALCL cell lines examined but absent in normal T-cells. By immunohistochemistry, Twist1 was detectable in all 10 cases of ALK+ALCL examined; benign lymphoid tissues were consistently negative. Twist1 expression in ALK+ALCL cells can be attributed to the NPM-ALK/STAT3 signaling axis, the key oncogenic driving force in this tumor type. Twist1 is biologically important in ALK+ALCL cells, as Twist1 knockdown resulted in a significant decrease in their invasiveness in an in-vitro assay. Further investigation revealed that this increase in invasiveness is linked to the activation of AKT and down-regulation of p66Shc, two signaling proteins known to be involved in NPM-ALK-mediated oncogenesis.

However, the expression levels of and the relationship between TWIST, E-cadherin, and beta-catenin in bladder cancer are not yet known. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between TWIST, E-cadherin, and beta-catenin in tissue specimens and cell lines of bladder cancer. METHODS: Microarrays of bladder cancer tissue and bladder cancer cell lines were used to study the expression levels of TWIST, E-cadherin, and beta-catenin, with disease stage and grade using immunohistochemistry. Moreover, the siRNAs of TWIST, E-cadherin, and beta-catenin were transfected into the bladder cancer cell lines to study any relationship between these factors. RESULTS: The levels of TWIST and beta-catenin were upregulated with increasing grade of malignancy. In contrast, the corresponding results for E-cadherin were just the opposite. Furthermore, inhibition of the expression of TWIST elevated the expression of E-cadherin, but reduced the expression of beta-catenin. However, reduction of beta-catenin by siRNA had no influence on TWIST, but up-regulated the expression of E-cadherin.

However, it has not been elucidated the characteristics of telomere maintenance and progression ability after long-term culture in bladder cancer T24 cells with hTERT dysfunction. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, by using a dominant negative mutant human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) vector to inhibit TA in bladder cancer T24 cells, we observed the appearance of long phenotype of telomere length and the ALT-associated PML body (APB) complex after the 27(th) passage, indicating the occurrence of ALT-like pathway in surviving T24/DN868A cells with telomerase inhibition.

Twist and N-cadherin mRNA and protein levels were determined by RT-PCR and Western blotting in human placental tissues, highly invasive EVT, and poorly invasive JEG-3 and BeWo cells. Whether IL-1β and TGF-β1 regulate Twist mRNA and protein levels in the EVT was also examined. A small interfering RNA strategy was employed to determine the role of Twist and N-cadherin in HTR-8/SVneo cell invasion. Matrigel assays were used to assess cell invasion. Twist and N-cadherin were highly expressed in EVT but were poorly expressed in JEG-3 and BeWo cells. IL-1β and TGF-β1 differentially regulated Twist expression in EVT in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Small interfering RNA specific for Twist decreased N-cadherin and reduced invasion of HTR-8/SVneo cells. Similarly, a reduction in N-cadherin decreased the invasive capacity of HTR-8/SVneo cells. Twist is an upstream regulator of N-cadherin-mediated invasion of human trophoblastic cells.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"22102471","pmcid":null,"title":"Endogenous TWIST expression and differentiation are opposite during human muscle development.","authors":["Koutsoulidou A","Mastroyiannopoulos NP","Furling D","Uney JB","Phylactou LA"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Muscle & nerve","journalShort":"Muscle Nerve","day":21,"month":12,"year":2011,"meshHeadings":["Cell Differentiation","Cells, Cultured","Female","Fetal Development","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Humans","Infant, Newborn","Muscle Development","Nuclear Proteins","Pregnancy","Twist Transcription Factor"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"TWIST is a transcription factor expressed during early embryonic development.

ARTN is also expressed in ER negative mammary carcinoma (ER-MC). Herein, we determined the role of ARTN in ER-MC and defined the mechanism of action producing poor patient prognosis. METHODS: We modulated the expression of ARTN in two ER- (mesenchymal/claudin-low) mammary carcinoma cell lines (BT549 and MDA-MB-231) by forced expression or small interfering RNA (siRNA) mediated depletion. The effects of modulation of ARTN expression were examined by various in vitro measures of oncogenicity, including the expression of TWIST1 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein. In vitro results were correlated to xenograft studies in immunodeficient mice. Co-expression of ARTN and TWIST1 and their association to poor survival outcome were examined in a cohort of patients with ER-MC. Pathway analysis was performed by pharmacological inhibition of phosphorylation of AKT (pAKT-Ser 473) or modulation of TWIST1 expression. RESULTS: ARTN expression resulted in ER-MC cells with enhanced mesenchymal characteristics, including increased invasion and a gene expression profile consistent with enhanced mesenchymal phenotype. ARTN stimulated ER-MC cell anchorage independent and 3D matrigel growth, endothelial cell adhesion and transmigration of ER-MC cells through an endothelial cell barrier. Forced expression of ARTN produced a larger, locally invasive tumour mass with tumour emboli that produced distant metastasis. ARTN regulated TWIST1 expression in ER-MC cells and ARTN expression was significantly correlated to TWIST1 expression in a panel of mammary carcinoma cell lines and in a cohort of patients with ER-MC. Low expression of both ARTN and TWIST1 predicted 100% relapse free and overall survival in patients with ER-MC, whereas high expression of both ARTN and TWIST1 was associated with a poor survival outcome. ARTN stimulated an increase in TWIST1 expression via increased AKT activity. siRNA mediated depletion of TWIST1 abrogated ARTN stimulated cellular behaviour associated with metastasis, and forced expression of TWIST1 abrogated the functional effects of ARTN depletion. CONCLUSIONS: ARTN and TWIST1 synergize to produce a worse outcome in ER-MC and combined inhibition of ARTN and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) may therefore provide a novel therapeutic strategy in this subtype of mammary carcinoma.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"22253230","pmcid":null,"title":"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition induced by TNF-α requires NF-κB-mediated transcriptional upregulation of Twist1.","authors":["Li CW","Xia W","Huo L","Lim SO","Wu Y","Hsu JL","Chao CH","Yamaguchi H","Yang NK","Ding Q","Wang Y","Lai YJ","LaBaff AM","Wu TJ","Lin BR","Yang MH","Hortobagyi GN","Hung MC"],"grantIds":["CA09903","CA109311","CA16672","P01 CA099031","P01 CA099031-08","P30 CA016672","P30 CA016672-37","P50 CA116199","P50 CA116199-05","R01 CA109311","R01 CA109311-09"],"grantAgencies":["NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Cancer research","journalShort":"Cancer Res.","day":1,"month":3,"year":2012,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Breast Neoplasms","Carrier Proteins","Cell Line, Tumor","Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition","Female","Humans","I-kappa B Kinase","Inflammation","Lung Neoplasms","Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental","Mice","Mice, Inbred BALB C","NF-kappa B","Neoplasm Proteins","Nuclear Proteins","Transcriptional Activation","Transfection","Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha","Twist Transcription Factor","Up-Regulation"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Proinflammatory cytokines produced in the tumor microenvironment facilitate tumor development and metastatic progression. In particular, TNF-α promotes cancer invasion and angiogenesis associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT); however, the mechanisms underlying its induction of EMT in cancer cells remain unclear. Here we show that EMT and cancer stemness properties induced by chronic treatment with TNF-α are mediated by the upregulation of the transcriptional repressor Twist1. Exposure to TNF-α rapidly induced Twist1 mRNA and protein expression in normal breast epithelial and breast cancer cells. Both IKK-β and NF-κB p65 were required for TNF-α-induced expression of Twist1, suggesting the involvement of canonical NF-κB signaling. In support of this likelihood, we defined a functional NF-κB-binding site in the Twist1 promoter, and overexpression of p65 was sufficient to induce transcriptional upregulation of Twist1 along with EMT in mammary epithelial cells. Conversely, suppressing Twist1 expression abrogated p65-induced cell migration, invasion, EMT, and stemness properties, establishing that Twist1 is required for NF-κB to induce these aggressive phenotypes in breast cancer cells. Taken together, our results establish a signaling axis through which the tumor microenvironment elicits Twist1 expression to promote cancer metastasis. We suggest that targeting NF-κB-mediated Twist1 upregulation may offer an effective a therapeutic strategy for breast cancer treatment.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"22178381","pmcid":null,"title":"Prognostic role of Twist, Slug, and Foxc2 expression in stage I non-small-cell lung cancer after curative resection.","authors":["Jiang W","Pang XG","Wang Q","Shen YX","Chen XK","Xi JJ"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Clinical lung cancer","journalShort":"Clin Lung Cancer","day":4,"month":7,"year":2012,"meshHeadings":["Aged","Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung","Female","Forkhead Transcription Factors","Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic","Humans","Immunohistochemistry","Kaplan-Meier Estimate","Lung Neoplasms","Male","Middle Aged","Nuclear Proteins","Prognosis","Transcription Factors","Tumor Markers, Biological","Twist Transcription Factor"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"By using immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays of 137 cases, we evaluated the prognostic power of a 3-marker epithelial-mesenchymal transition–related model in patients with stage I non-small-cell lung cancer who underwent radical surgical resection.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the world. Only about 60% of patients with stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can be cured by surgery alone. Current clinical and molecular markers are inadequate prognosticators. We developed a 3-marker model that closely approximates survival probability of patients with stage I NSCLC. METHODS: Expression of Twist, Slug, and Foxc2 was assessed by immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays that contained paired tumor and peritumoral lung tissue from 137 patients who underwent surgical resection for stage I NSCLC. The prognostic value of Twist, Slug, and Foxc2, and the cumulative effects of the 3 markers on survival were evaluated. RESULTS: Increased expression of Twist, Slug, and Foxc2 was observed in 38.0%, 18.2%, and 27.7% of primary tumors, respectively. Overexpression of Twist, Slug, and Foxc2 in stage I NSCLC was associated with a worse overall survival (P = .001, P = .002, P < .001, respectively) and correlated with a shorter recurrence-free survival (P < .001, P = .001, P < .001 respectively). The cumulative influence of these markers on outcome was analyzed; a combination of more than 2 positive markers was an independent predictor of recurrence-free and overall survival (P = .002 and P = .009, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The Twist/Slug/Foxc2 model is useful in predicting survival of stage I NSCLC and may be helpful in refining current treatment strategy.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"22290439","pmcid":null,"title":"Twist-1 induces Ezh2 recruitment regulating histone methylation along the Ink4A/Arf locus in mesenchymal stem cells.","authors":["Cakouros D","Isenmann S","Cooper L","Zannettino A","Anderson P","Glackin C","Gronthos S"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Molecular and cellular biology","journalShort":"Mol.

HMGA2 associates with Smad complexes and induces expression of an established regulator of EMT, the zinc finger transcription factor Snail. We now show that HMGA2 can also induce expression of a second regulator of EMT, the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Twist.

The Twist1 gene encodes for a transcription factor that is essential during embryogenesis. Twist1 has been suggested to play an important role during tumor progression. However, there is no in vivo evidence that Twist1 plays a role in autochthonous tumorigenesis. Through two novel transgenic mouse models, we show that Twist1 cooperates with Kras(G12D) to markedly accelerate lung tumorigenesis by abrogating cellular senescence programs and promoting the progression from benign adenomas to adenocarcinomas. Moreover, the suppression of Twist1 to physiological levels is sufficient to cause Kras mutant lung tumors to undergo senescence and lose their neoplastic features. Finally, we analyzed more than 500 human tumors to demonstrate that TWIST1 is frequently overexpressed in primary human lung tumors.

We previously showed that EGFR mutations were associated with a copy number gain at a locus encompassing the TWIST1 gene on chromosome 7. TWIST1 is a highly conserved developmental gene involved in embryogenesis that may be reactivated in cancers promoting both malignant conversion and cancer progression through an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). The aim of this study was to investigate the possible implication of TWIST1 reactivation on the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype in EGFR mutated lung cancer. We studied a series of consecutive lung adenocarcinoma from Caucasian non-smokers for which surgical frozen samples were available (n = 33) and showed that TWIST1 expression was linked to EGFR mutations (P<0.001), to low CDH1 expression (P<0.05) and low disease free survival (P = 0.044). To validate that TWIST1 is a driver of EMT in EGFR mutated lung cancer, we used five human lung cancer cell lines and demonstrated that EMT and the associated cell mobility were dependent upon TWIST1 expression in cells with EGFR mutation. Moreover a decrease of EGFR pathway stimulation through EGF retrieval or an inhibition of TWIST1 expression by small RNA technology reversed the phenomenon. Collectively, our in vivo and in vitro findings support that TWIST1 collaborates with the EGF pathway in promoting EMT in EGFR mutated lung adenocarcinoma and that large series of EGFR mutated lung cancer patients are needed to further define the prognostic role of TWIST1 reactivation in this subgroup.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"22515221","pmcid":null,"title":"Increased Twist expression in advanced stage of mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome.","authors":["Goswami M","Duvic M","Dougherty A","Ni X"],"grantIds":["P30 CA016672","P30 CA016672"],"grantAgencies":["NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Journal of cutaneous pathology","journalShort":"J.

Twist, a transcription factor, is thought to promote solid tumor progression by blocking p53 and inhibiting c-myc-induced apoptosis. Whether Twist expression is correlated to MF/SS stages remains unknown. METHODS: Twist, c-myc and p53 proteins in 68 MF/SS lesions across all T stages were examined by immunohistochemistry, and mRNA levels in peripheral blood CD4+ T-cells from SS patients were measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Positive staining for Twist was found in 12.5% (2/16) of T1 and 33.3% (7/21) of T2 early stage patches/plaques compared to 50.0% (9/18) of T3 tumors and 84.6% (11/13) of T4 erythroderma. Most T4 erythroderma were positive for Twist in dermal lymphocytes, with the strongest staining. Positive staining for c-myc was higher in T3/T4 lesions (29/31, 93.5%) than T1/T2 lesions (25/37, 67.6%, p < 0.05), with strongest staining in T3 tumors.

Twist1, through its carboxyl-terminal Twist-box, binds to the Sox9 high mobility group DNA-binding domain, inhibiting Sox9 transactivation potential. In chondrocyte precursor cells, Twist1, in a Twist-box-dependent manner, inhibits Sox9-dependent activation of chondrocyte marker gene expression by blocking Sox9-enhancer DNA association.

Snail was expressed to a greater extent in the group with positive lymph nodes (68.4%), whereas Twist was overexpressed in patients with other metastases (75.0%). Ectopic expression of Snail and Twist correlated with reduced membranous expression of E-cadherin. Importantly, Snail overexpression correlated significantly with lymph node metastasis (P < .0001), whereas Twist up-regulation correlated strongly with other metastases (P < .0001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that Snail was an independent predictor of lymph node metastasis (odds ratio, 4.445; 95% confidence interval, 2.250-8.781; P < .0001), whereas Twist displayed predictive value for metastasis formation (odds ratio, 5.606; 95% confidence interval, 2.829-11.111; P < .0001), suggesting that lymph node and other metastases may follow different signaling pathways.

Notch signaling and transcription factors STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) and Twist regulate tumor development and are critical regulators of gastric cancer progression. Herein, the relationship among Notch, STAT3 and Twist pathways in the control of gastric cancer progression was studied. We found that Twist and phosphorylated STAT3 levels were promoted by the activated Notch1 receptor in human stomach adenocarcinoma SC-M1, embryonic kidney HEK293 and erythroleukemia K562 cells. Notch1 signaling dramatically induced Twist promoter activity through a C promoter binding factor-1-independent manner and STAT3 phosphorylation. Overexpression of Notch1 receptor intracellular domain (N1IC) enhanced the interaction between nuclear STAT3 and Twist promoter in cells. Gastric cancer progression of SC-M1 cells was promoted by N1IC through STAT3 phosphorylation and Twist expression including colony formation, migration and invasion. STAT3 regulated gastric cancer progression of SC-M1 cells via Twist. N1IC also elevated the progression of other gastric cancer cells such as AGS and KATO III cells through STAT3 and Twist. The N1IC-promoted tumor growth and lung metastasis of SC-M1 cells in mice were suppressed by the STAT3 inhibitor JSI-124 and Twist knockdown. Furthermore, Notch1 and Notch ligand Jagged1 expressions were significantly associated with phosphorylated STAT3 and Twist levels in gastric cancer tissues of patients. Taken together, these results suggest that Notch1/STAT3/Twist signaling axis is involved in progression of human gastric cancer and modulation of this cascade has potential for the targeted combination therapy.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"22847601","pmcid":null,"title":"Prognostic value of Twist and E-cadherin in patients with osteosarcoma.","authors":["Yin K","Liao Q","He H","Zhong D"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)","journalShort":"Med.

In particular, coronal synostosis evidences a higher tendency to be genetically caused, and TWIST1 and FGFR3 have been identified as major causative genes. The authors analyzed the clinical and molecular characteristics of Korean patients with coronal synostosis in this study. METHODS: Forty-three Korean patients with unicoronal or bicoronal synostosis were included in this study. All samples were first screened for TWIST1 and FGFR3 mutation hot spots, and the negative samples were subsequently screened for FGFR2. The patients' clinical features were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: Seven sequence alterations (six in TWIST1 and one in FGFR3) were identified in 11 patients (25.6 percent). Three novel TWIST1 mutations were detected, and p.P250R was the only mutation in FGFR3. Bicoronal cases evidenced a much higher mutation detection rate (52.9 percent) than unicoronal cases (7.7 percent).

The histone methyltransferase MMSET/WHSC1 (Multiple Myeloma SET domain) is overexpressed in a number of metastatic tumors, but its mechanism of action has not been defined. In this work, we found that PCa cell lines expressed significantly higher levels of MMSET compared with immortalized, non-transformed prostate cells. Knockdown experiments showed that, in metastatic PCa cell lines, dimethylation of lysine 36 and trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K36me2 and H3K27me3, respectively) depended on MMSET expression, whereas depletion of MMSET in benign prostatic cells did not affect chromatin modifications. Knockdown of MMSET in DU145 and PC-3 tumor cells decreased cell proliferation, colony formation in soft agar and strikingly diminished cell migration and invasion. Conversely, overexpression of MMSET in immortalized, non-transformed RWPE-1 cells promoted cell migration and invasion, accompanied by an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Among a panel of EMT-promoting genes analyzed, TWIST1 expression was strongly activated in response to MMSET. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that MMSET binds to the TWIST1 locus and leads to an increase in H3K36me2, suggesting a direct role of MMSET in the regulation of this gene. Depletion of TWIST1 in MMSET-overexpressing RWPE-1 cells blocked cell invasion and EMT, indicating that TWIST1 was a critical target of MMSET, responsible for the acquisition of an invasive phenotype.

MATERIALS & METHODS: Primary osteoblast cultures were generated from intertrochanteric trabecular bone samples from five female primary hip OA cases and five age-matched female CTLs. During a 42-day differentiation time-course, alizarin red stains, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and real-time RT-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to quantify calcium, elemental composition and gene expression, respectively. Data were analysed using linear mixed effects models and Pearson correlation matrices. RESULTS: Significant differences, correlations and associations were found in OA and CTL osteoblasts between gene and mineral measures. The calcium: phosphorous (Ca:P) ratio was significantly more varied in OA compared to CTL. Calcium apposition, mineral composition as well as TWIST1 and TGFβ1 mRNA expression changed significantly over time. TWIST1 mRNA expression was elevated and correlated with SMAD3 mRNA levels in the OA cohort during the time-course. Associations were observed between tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), osteocalcin (OCN), TWIST1, TGFβ1, SMAD3 mRNA levels and mineral measures in OA against CTL. Temporal differences between SMAD3 mRNA expression and mineral composition were also found in OA.

Moscatilin, derived from the orchid Dendrobrium loddigesii, has shown anticancer activity. We evaluated the mechanism by which moscatilin suppresses the migration and metastasis of human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated that moscatilin significantly inhibits MDA-MB-231 cell migration by using scratch assays and Boyden chambers. Transcriptional factors inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition, such as Twist, Snail, and Akt, play important roles in cell migration and cancer metastasis. Moscatilin inhibited the mRNA and protein expression of Twist, but not that of Snail, and subsequently inhibited N-cadherin expression. However, these effects were reversed by constitutively expressing active myristoylated (myr)-Akt and Twist overexpression. Moscatilin also suppressed Akt phosphorylation. However, Akt overexpression reversed the inhibitory effects of moscatilin on phospho-Akt protein expression but not its effects on Twist. The moscatilin-mediated inhibition of cell migration was reversed by Akt and Twist overexpression, demonstrating that moscatilin blocked cell migration by inhibiting Akt and Twist. In an MDA-MB-231 metastatic animal model, moscatilin (100 mg/kg) significantly suppressed breast cancer metastasis to the lungs and reduced the number of metastatic lung nodules and lung weight without causing any toxicity. These results indicated that moscatilin inhibited MDA-MB-231 cell migration via Akt- and Twist-dependent pathways; this finding was consistent with moscatilin's antimetastatic activity in vivo. Therefore, moscatilin may be an effective compound for the prevention of human breast cancer metastasis.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"23150175","pmcid":null,"title":"Expression of TWIST1, Snail, Slug, and NF-κB and methylation of the TWIST1 promoter in mammary phyllodes tumor.","authors":["Do SI","Kim JY","Kang SY","Lee JJ","Lee JE","Nam SJ","Cho EY"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine","journalShort":"Tumour Biol.","day":21,"month":2,"year":2013,"meshHeadings":["Adolescent","Adult","Aged","Breast Neoplasms","Child","DNA Methylation","Female","Humans","Middle Aged","NF-kappa B","Nuclear Proteins","Phyllodes Tumor","Promoter Regions, Genetic","Transcription Factors","Tumor Markers, Biological","Twist Transcription Factor","Young Adult"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"TWIST1, Slug, Snail, SIP1, and NF-κB are overexpressed in various tumors and associated with metastasis and poor prognosis.

Aberrant DNA methylation is present in all bladder tumors and can be detected in urine specimens. Previous studies have identified DNA methylation markers that showed significant diagnostic value. We evaluated the significance of the biomarkers for early detection of tumor recurrence in urine. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The methylation levels of EOMES, HOXA9, POU4F2, TWIST1, VIM, and ZNF154 in urine specimens were measured by real-time PCR (MethyLight). We analyzed 390 urine sediments from 184 patients diagnosed with NMIBC. Urine from 35 age-matched control individuals was used to determine the methylation baseline levels. Recurrence was diagnosed by cystoscopy and verified by histology. Initially, we compared urine from bladder cancer patients and healthy individuals and detected significant hypermethylation of all six markers (P<0.0001) achieving sensitivity in the range 82%-89% and specificity in the range 94%-100%. Following, we validated the urinary hypermethylation for use in recurrence surveillance and found sensitivities of 88-94% and specificities of 43-67%. EOMES, POU4F2, VIM and ZNF154 were more frequently methylated in urine from patients with higher grade tumors (P ≤ 0.08). Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that five markers were significantly associated with disease recurrence; HOXA9 (HR=7.8, P=0.006), POU4F2 (HR=8.5, P=0.001), TWIST1 (HR=12.0, P=0.015), VIM (HR=8.0, P=0.001), and ZNF154 (HR=13.9, P<0.001). Interestingly, for one group of patients (n=15) we found that hypermethylation was consistently present in the urine samples despite the lack of tumor recurrences, indicating the presence of a field defect. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Methylation levels of EOMES, HOXA9, POU4F2, TWIST1, VIM, and ZNF154 in urine specimens are promising diagnostic biomarkers for bladder cancer recurrence surveillance.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"23873099","pmcid":null,"title":"Twist: a molecular target in cancer therapeutics.","authors":["Khan MA","Chen HC","Zhang D","Fu J"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine","journalShort":"Tumour Biol.","day":30,"month":10,"year":2013,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Antineoplastic Agents","Drug Resistance, Neoplasm","Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition","Gene Expression","Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic","Humans","Molecular Targeted Therapy","Neoplasm Metastasis","Neoplasms","Neoplastic Stem Cells","Nuclear Proteins","Twist Transcription Factor"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Twist, the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, is involved in the process of epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (EMTs), which play an essential role in cancer metastasis. Overexpression of Twist or its promoter methylation is a common scenario in metastatic carcinomas. Twist is activated by a variety of signal transduction pathways, including Akt, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, mitogen-activated protein kinase, Ras, and Wnt signaling. Activated Twist upregulates N-cadherin and downregulates E-cadherin, which are the hallmarks of EMT. Moreover, Twist plays an important role in some physiological processes involved in metastasis, like angiogenesis, invadopodia, extravasation, and chromosomal instability. Twist also protects cancer cells from apoptotic cell death. In addition, Twist is responsible for the stemness of cancer cells and the generation of drug resistance. Recently, targeting Twist has gained significant interests in cancer therapeutics. The inactivation of Twist by small RNA technology or chemotherapeutic approach has been proved successful. Moreover, several inhibitors which are antagonistic to the upstream or downstream molecules of Twist signaling pathways have also been identified. Development of potential treatment strategies by targeting Twist has a great promise in cancer therapeutics.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"23375009","pmcid":null,"title":"Degradation of the transcription factor Twist, an oncoprotein that promotes cancer metastasis.","authors":["Zhong J","Ogura K","Wang Z","Inuzuka H"],"grantIds":["K01 AG041218"],"grantAgencies":["NIA NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Discovery medicine","journalShort":"Discov Med","day":4,"month":1,"year":2013,"meshHeadings":["Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition","HeLa Cells","Humans","I-kappa B Kinase","Models, Biological","Phosphorylation","Twist Transcription Factor","beta-Transducin Repeat-Containing Proteins"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor Twist is one of the key inducers of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) that is a transdifferentiation program associated with embryo development and tumor metastasis.

In the present study, we identified Twist to be a ubiquitin substrate of β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TRCP), the adaptor subunit of SCF(β-TRCP) (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein) E3 ligase complex. We observed that depletion of β-TRCP leads to an accumulation of Twist protein, which could enhance tumor cell motility and cancer metastasis. Moreover, phosphorylation of Twist by inhibitor of KappaB kinase β (IKKβ) at multiple sites triggers its cytoplasmic translocation and the destruction by SCF(β-TRCP). Thus, our results provide the potential molecular mechanism of how the mesenchymal marker Twist is degraded, thereby shedding lights into regulation of the EMT, and providing the rationale for development of new therapeutic intervention to achieve better treatment outcomes in human cancer.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"23161342","pmcid":null,"title":"HBx-dependent activation of Twist mediates STAT3 control of epithelium-mesenchymal transition of liver cells.","authors":["Teng J","Wang X","Xu Z","Tang N"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Journal of cellular biochemistry","journalShort":"J.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition has been implicated in progression from well to poorly differentiated/anaplastic thyroid carcinoma but the expression of SNAI2 and TWIST1 proteins and their phenotypic association in human thyroid cancers has not been extensively studied. We examined the expression of SNAI2, TWIST1 and CDH1 by immunohistochemistry in a panel of well-differentiated and anaplastic thyroid cancers and by qRT-PCR in thyroid cell lines. Ten normal thyroids, 33 follicular adenomas, 56 papillary thyroid carcinomas including 28 follicular variants, 27 follicular carcinomas and 10 anaplastic thyroid carcinomas were assembled on a tissue microarray and immunostained for SNAI2, TWIST1 and CDH1. Most (8/10) anaplastic thyroid carcinomas demonstrated strong nuclear immunoreactivity for SNAI2 with associated absence of CDH1 in 6/8 cases (75%). TWIST1 was expressed in 5/10 anaplastic thyroid carcinomas with absence of CDH1 in 3/5 (60%) cases. These findings were confirmed in whole sections of all anaplastic thyroid carcinomas and in a separate validation set of 10 additional anaplastic thyroid carcinomas. All normal thyroids, follicular adenomas, papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas were negative for SNAI2 and TWIST1 (P<0.0001) and all showed strong diffuse immunoreactivity for CDH1 (P=0.026).

However, mechanisms underlying TWIST1 expression and whether aberrant TWIST1 levels promote steps in melanoma progression remain unknown. Here, we report that elevated TWIST1 mRNA/protein expression is dependent on extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 signaling, which is hyperactive in the majority of melanomas.

Furthermore, TWIST1 expression is required and sufficient to promote invasion through Matrigel and spheroid outgrowth in three-dimensional dermal-mimetic conditions. Alterations to spheroid outgrowth were not as a result of altered cell death, cell-cycle profile, or paradigm EMT protein changes. Importantly, we identify matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) as a novel downstream target of TWIST1. We have determined that TWIST1 acts, in a dose-dependent manner, as a mediator between hyperactive ERK1/2 signaling and regulation of MMP-1 transcription.

Measured genotype analysis was performed between genetic markers and obesity-related traits i.e., anthropometry, body composition, growth, metabolites, hormones, inflammation, diet, energy expenditure, substrate utilization and physical activity. Identified genome-wide significant loci: 1) corroborated genes implicated in other studies (MTNR1B, ZNF259/APOA5, XPA/FOXE1 (TTF-2), DARC, CCR3, ABO); 2) localized novel genes in plausible biological pathways (PCSK2, ARHGAP11A, CHRNA3); and 3) revealed novel genes with unknown function in obesity pathogenesis (MATK, COL4A1).

METHODS: An RNA interference plasmid expressing a small interfering RNA (siRNA)-targeting Twist (Twist siRNA vector) was designed, constructed, and transfected into the human ovarian cancer cell line A2780. Transfection efficiency was assessed under a fluorescence microscope. Changes in the expression of Twist mRNA in A2780 after transfection with the pGenesil Twist shRNA plasmid were analyzed through RT-PCR. MTT assays and adhesion experiments were applied to determine changes in proliferation and adhesion ability of A2870 after transfection with the Twist shRNA plasmid. Changes in the expression of the E-cadherin and N-cadherin proteins in A2780 after transfection with the Twist shRNA plasmid were analyzed using Western blotting. RESULT: The restructuring plasmid pGenesil-Twist shRNA was constructed successfully. After 48 h of culture, 80% of the cells expressed high-intensity GFP fluorescence and stability. The expression of Twist decreased significantly after the transfection of the Twist shRNA plasmid (P<0.05). Proliferation of the transfected Twist shRNA cells showed no difference with that of the A2780-nontransfection or A2780-si-control groups (P>0.05) but the adhesion ability of A2780 decreased dramatically (P<0.05).

Although Twist1 also plays a role in embryonic vascular development and tumor angiogenesis, the molecular mechanisms that underlie these processes are not as well understood. Here, we report a novel function for Twist1 in modifying the tumor microenvironment to promote progression. We found that expression of Twist1 in human mammary epithelial cells potently promoted angiogenesis. Surprisingly, Twist1 expression did not increase the secretion of the common proangiogenic factors VEGF and basic fibroblast growth factor but rather induced expression of the macrophage chemoattractant CCL2. Attenuation of endogenous Twist1 in vivo blocked macrophage recruitment and angiogenesis, whereas exogenous CCL2 rescued the ability of tumor cells lacking Twist1 to attract macrophages and promote angiogenesis. Macrophage recruitment also was essential for the ability of Twist1-expressing cells to elicit a strong angiogenic response. Together, our findings show that how Twist1 recruits stromal macrophages through CCL2 induction to promote angiogenesis and tumor progression. As Twist1 expression has been associated with poor survival in many human cancers, this finding suggests that anti-CCL2 therapy may offer a rational strategy to treat Twist1-positive metastatic cancers.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"23364532","pmcid":null,"title":"Inhibition of TWIST1 leads to activation of oncogene-induced senescence in oncogene-driven non-small cell lung cancer.","authors":["Burns TF","Dobromilskaya I","Murphy SC","Gajula RP","Thiyagarajan S","Chatley SN","Aziz K","Cho YJ","Tran PT","Rudin CM"],"grantIds":["P30 CA006973","P50 CA058184","P50 CA103175"],"grantAgencies":["NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Molecular cancer research : MCR","journalShort":"Mol.

Although targeted agents exist for EGFR- and EML4-ALK-driven NSCLCs, no therapies target the most frequently found driver mutation, KRAS. Furthermore, acquired resistance to the currently targetable driver mutations is nearly universally observed. Clearly a novel therapeutic approach is needed to target oncogene-driven NSCLCs. We recently showed that the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Twist1 cooperates with mutant Kras to induce lung adenocarcinoma in transgenic mouse models and that inhibition of Twist1 in these models led to Kras-induced senescence. In the current study, we examine the role of TWIST1 in oncogene-driven human NSCLCs. Silencing of TWIST1 in KRAS-mutant human NSCLC cell lines resulted in dramatic growth inhibition and either activation of a latent oncogene-induced senescence program or, in some cases, apoptosis. Similar effects were observed in EGFR mutation-driven and c-Met-amplified NSCLC cell lines. Growth inhibition by silencing of TWIST1 was independent of p53 or p16 mutational status and did not require previously defined mediators of senescence, p21 and p27, nor could this phenotype be rescued by overexpression of SKP2. In xenograft models, silencing of TWIST1 resulted in significant growth inhibition of KRAS-mutant, EGFR-mutant, and c-Met-amplified NSCLCs. Remarkably, inducible silencing of TWIST1 resulted in significant growth inhibition of established KRAS-mutant tumors. Together these findings suggest that silencing of TWIST1 in oncogene driver-dependent NSCLCs represents a novel and promising therapeutic strategy.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"23280703","pmcid":null,"title":"TWIST interacts with β-catenin signaling on osteosarcoma cell survival against cisplatin.","authors":["Wu J","Liao Q","He H","Zhong D","Yin K"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Molecular carcinogenesis","journalShort":"Mol.

In the present study, we explored the regulatory effect of TWIST on β-catenin in osteosarcoma cells and assessed how the functional interaction between TWIST and β-catenin would impact osteosarcoma cell survival against chemotherapy agent cisplatin. Overexpression and knockdown of TWIST were respectively performed in Saos-2 and MG-63 osteosarcoma cells. Overexpression of TWIST in Saos-2 cells significantly decreased the soluble β-catenin level, phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) at serine 9, the mRNA level of β-catenin signaling target genes, and cell survival against cisplatin, which was strengthened by knocking down β-catenin. Knockdown of TWIST in MG-63 cells significantly increased the soluble β-catenin level, phosphorylation of GSK-3β at serine 9, the mRNA level of β-catenin signaling target genes, and cell survival against cisplatin, which was reversed by knocking down β-catenin or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002.

Genetic disruption of TWIST1 resulted in a cachectic phenotype and early death of the knock-out mice. This might be connected to the activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome-system (UPS), as miR-199a has been suggested to regulate the ubiquitin E2 ligases Ube2i and Ube2g1. METHODS: Cardiac tissue from explanted hearts of 42 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and 20 healthy donor hearts were analysed for protein expression of TWIST1 and its inhibitors Id-1, MuRF-1 and MAFbx, the expression of miR-199a, -199b and -214, as well as the activity of the UPS by using specific fluorogenic substrates. RESULTS: TWIST1 was repressed in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy by 43% (p=0.003), while Id1 expression was unchanged. This was paralleled by a reduced expression of miR-199a by 38 ± 9% (p=0.053), miR-199b by 36 ± 13% (p=0.019) and miR-214 by 41 ± 11% (p=0.0158) compared to donor hearts. An increased peptidylglutamyl-peptide-hydrolysing activity (p<0.0001) was observed in the UPS, while the chymotrypsin-like and trypsin-like activities were unchanged. The protein levels of the rate limiting ubiquitin E3-ligases MuRF-1 and MAFbx were up-regulated (p=0.005 and p=0.0156, respectively). Mechanistically silencing of TWIST1 using siRNA in primary rat cardiomyocytes led to a down-regulation of the miR-199/214 cluster and to a subsequent up-regulation of Ube2i. CONCLUSION: The TWIST1/miR-199/214 axis is down-regulated in dilated cardiomyopathy, which is likely to play a role in the increased activity of the UPS. This may contribute to the loss of cardiac mass during dilatation of the heart.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"23354436","pmcid":null,"title":"Mutations in TCF12, encoding a basic helix-loop-helix partner of TWIST1, are a frequent cause of coronal craniosynostosis.","authors":["Sharma VP","Fenwick AL","Brockop MS","McGowan SJ","Goos JA","Hoogeboom AJ","Brady AF","Jeelani NO","Lynch SA","Mulliken JB","Murray DJ","Phipps JM","Sweeney E","Tomkins SE","Wilson LC","Bennett S","Cornall RJ","Broxholme J","Kanapin A","500 Whole-Genome Sequences (WGS500) Consortium","Johnson D","Wall SA","van der Spek PJ","Mathijssen IM","Maxson RE","Twigg SR","Wilkie AO"],"grantIds":["090532","093329","093329","095552","R01 DE016320","R01 DE019650","R01DE016320","R01DE019650"],"grantAgencies":["Wellcome Trust","Wellcome Trust","Wellcome Trust","Wellcome Trust","NIDCR NIH HHS","NIDCR NIH HHS","NIDCR NIH HHS","NIDCR NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Nature genetics","journalShort":"Nat.

CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that URG11 staining in renal biopsy specimens might be a novel histological marker for progression in IgAN patients.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"23613408","pmcid":null,"title":"Expression of transcription factor Twist1 in bladder urothelial carcinoma and its clinical significance.","authors":["Tang X","Xing J","Li W","Wu Z","Zhang K","Zheng J"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology","journalShort":"J BUON","day":24,"month":4,"year":2013,"meshHeadings":["Carcinoma","Chi-Square Distribution","Female","Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic","Humans","Immunohistochemistry","Male","Middle Aged","Neoplasm Grading","Neoplasm Staging","Nuclear Proteins","Prognosis","RNA, Messenger","Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction","Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction","Risk Factors","Smoking","Time Factors","Tumor Markers, Biological","Twist Transcription Factor","Urinary Bladder Neoplasms","Urothelium"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"PURPOSE: Transcription factor Twist1 is known to play a vital role in cancer development, progression and metastasis. However, regulation mechanisms beneath Twist1 expression, as well as the correlation between its expression and bladder urothelial carcinoma (BUC), are still under investigation. Herein, we tried to investigate the expression of Twist1 in BUC specimens and non-cancerous mucosas and illustrate their relationships with clinicopathological features. METHODS: The expression of Twist1 mRNA in 42 fresh BUC specimens and 13 paired non-cancerous mucosas was detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RFQ-RTPCR). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect the expression of Twist1 protein in 40 paraffin embedded BUC specimens and 14 paired non-cancerous mucosas, and their relationships with clinicopathological features. RESULTS: The expression levels of Twist1 mRNA in 13 paired BUC specimens were significantly lower than the non-cancerous mucosas. The positive expression rate of Twist1 protein in BUC specimens (90.0%; 36/40) was significantly higher than the non-cancerous mucosas (7.14%; 1/14). Twist1 protein was mainly distributed in the nucleus, and expressed obviously in the mesenchymal cells of several specimens (13.9%;5/36). However, expressions of Twist1 protein were not associated with TNM stage and grade. It was also shown that the expression tendency of Twist1 protein was distinct from Twist1 mRNA, and both were not correlated with age, gender, and smoking history. CONCLUSION: As a probable potential biomarker for BUC, Twist1 gene may play a role as an oncogene during the tumorigenesis and development of BUC. Its abnormal protein expression may be associated with disordered regulations after transcription.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"23527594","pmcid":"3869052","title":"Interhelical loops within the bHLH domain are determinant in maintaining TWIST1-DNA complexes.","authors":["Bouard C","Terreux R","Hope J","Chemelle JA","Puisieux A","Ansieau S","Payen L"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics","journalShort":"J.

However, it is unknown whether a signal network and lncRNAs are involved in Twist-induced EMT program. Taking MCF10A/Twist as a model, more than 99 lncRNAs and 3164 genes are regulated in the Twist-induced EMT process using lncRNA-array and cDNA micro-array. We establish a downstream signal network associated with EMT induced by Twist using bioinformatic analysis (Gene Ontology, pathway analysis) and experimental data. A set of multiple canonical signal pathways (such as WNT, MAPK, JAK/STAT, TGF-β, mTOR, Hedgehog and P53 signaling pathways) and several lncRNAs [such as lncRNA (chr6, 26124411-26139312, +), lncRNA (chr1, 41944445-41949874, -), lncRNA (chr17, 44833874-44834830, +)] are altered in MCF10A/Twist cells.

However, the merits of taxanes remain modest, and efforts are needed to improve their therapeutic efficacy. METHODS: We evaluated the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to various agents using cytotoxicity assays. Gene and protein expression levels were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting analysis, respectively. RESULTS: Hydrogen peroxide-resistant and castration-resistant cells that overexpressed Twist1 and Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) were cross-resistant to cytotoxic agents, including docetaxel. Twist1 regulated YB-1 expression in prostate cancer cells, supported by the induction of Twist1 and YB-1 by transforming-growth factor-β, which is critical for taxane resistance. Twist1 and/or YB-1 were activated in docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells, and YB-1 was activated by docetaxel treatment. Conversely, Twist1 and YB-1 knockdown sensitized prostate cancer cells to cytotoxic agents, including docetaxel. In addition, androgen receptor (AR) knockdown increased cellular sensitivity to docetaxel, though AR expression in docetaxel-resistant LNCaP cells was paradoxically lower than in parental cells. Intriguingly, androgen deprivation treatment was more effective in docetaxel-resistant LNCaP cells compared with parental cells. CONCLUSIONS: Twist1/YB-1 and AR signaling promote docetaxel resistance in CRPC cells. However, docetaxel-resistant cells were collaterally sensitive to androgen deprivation because of down-regulation of AR expression, suggesting that the therapeutic effect of initial taxane treatment in hormone-naïve prostate cancer may be superior to that of salvage taxane treatment in CRPC.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"23682613","pmcid":null,"title":"Hypermethylation of TWIST1 and NID2 in tumor tissues and voided urine in urinary bladder cancer patients.","authors":["Yegin Z","Gunes S","Buyukalpelli R"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"DNA and cell biology","journalShort":"DNA Cell Biol.","day":2,"month":7,"year":2013,"meshHeadings":["Adult","Aged","Aged, 80 and over","Cell Adhesion Molecules","DNA Methylation","Female","Humans","Male","Middle Aged","Nuclear Proteins","Sensitivity and Specificity","Tumor Markers, Biological","Twist Transcription Factor","Urinary Bladder Neoplasms"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Bladder cancer like other cancers arises from the accumulation of many genetic and epigenetic changes that lead to the activation of proto-oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes.

However, there is no direct evidence that human cancer cells undergo an EMT. In mouse cancer cells, up-regulation of transcription factor Twist1 was shown to promote an EMT. We searched the stroma of human colorectal tumor samples for TWIST1-positive cells with a mesenchymal phenotype and neoplastic genotype. METHODS: We measured the expression of TWIST1 in human colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines and examined the effects of overexpression or knockdown in vitro and in mice. We used immunohistochemistry to measure levels of TWIST1 in 201 colorectal tumor samples. In 20 samples, immunostaining was combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses. Levels of TWIST1 messenger RNA (mRNA) were measured in blood samples from 15 patients. RESULTS: TWIST1 was required to maintain the mesenchymal phenotype and invasiveness of the microsatellite-stable CoLo741 cells (which express endogenous TWIST1) and SW480 (expressing transgenic TWIST1). TWIST1 mRNA was not translated in CRC cells with microsatellite instability (HCT116). Syngenic TWIST1-positive colon carcinoma cells (CT26) that invaded tissues surrounding tumors acquired a mesenchymal phenotype. The presence of TWIST1-positive cells in the stroma of human colorectal tumors correlated with microsatellite stability (P = .05), stage IV cancer (P = .02), and disease-free survival time (P < .01). Trisomies of chromosome 7 and/or chromosome 20 were detected in 17 of 20 colorectal tumor samples, each of which contained TWIST1-positive cells with matching chromosomal gains in the tumor stroma (86 of 776 counted cells; 11.1%). No trisomy was observed in TWIST1-negative stromal cells (0 of 1249 cells; P < .001). Levels of TWIST1 mRNA were significantly higher in blood samples from patients with CRC than controls.

METHODS: In-vitro invasion assay was used to evaluate whether the expression of Sox2 is linked to the invasiveness of MCF7 and ZR751 cells. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and/or Western blots were used to assess if Sox2 modulates the expression of factors known to regulate epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), such as Twist1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was used to assess the binding of Sox2 to the promoter region of Twist1. RESULTS: We found that siRNA knockdown of Sox2 expression significantly increased the invasiveness of MCF7 and ZR751 cells. However, when MCF7 cells were separated into two distinct subsets based on their differential responsiveness to the Sox2 reporter, the Sox2-mediated effects on invasiveness was observed only in 'reporter un-responsive' cells (RU cells) but not 'reporter responsive' cells (RR cells). Correlating with these findings, siRNA knockdown of Sox2 in RU cells, but not RR cells, dramatically increased the expression of Twist1. Accordingly, using ChIP, we found evidence that Sox2 binds to the promoter region of Twist1 in RU cells only. Lastly, siRNA knockdown of Twist1 largely abrogated the regulatory effect of Sox2 on the invasiveness in RU cells, suggesting that the observed Sox2-mediated effects are Twist1-dependent.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether Lcn2 is associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HCC and to elucidate the underlying signaling pathway(s). Lcn2 was preferentially expressed in well-differentiated HCC versus liver cirrhosis tissues, and its expression was positively correlated with the stage of HCC. The characteristics of EMT were reversed by adenoviral transduction of Lcn2 into SH-J1 cells, including the down-regulation of N-cadherin, vimentin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and fibronectin, and the concomitant up-regulation of CK8, CK18, and desmoplakin I/II. Knockdown of Lcn2 by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in HKK-2 cells expressing high levels of Lcn2 was associated with EMT. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) or transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-β1) treatment resulted in down-regulation of Lcn2, accompanied by an increase in Twist1 expression and EMT in HCC cells. Stable Lcn2 expression in SH-J1 cells reduced Twist1 expression, inhibited cell proliferation and invasion in vitro, and suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in a mouse model. Furthermore, EGF or TGF-β1 treatment barely changed EMT marker expression in SH-J1 cells ectopically expressing Lcn2. Ectopic expression of Twist1 induced EMT marker expression even in cells expressing Lcn2, indicating that Lcn2 functions downstream of growth factors and upstream of Twist1. CONCLUSION: Together, our findings indicate that Lcn2 can negatively modulate the EMT in HCC cells through an EGF (or TGF-β1)/Lcn2/Twist1 pathway.

WAVE2-knockdown (WAVE2-KD) cells formed large multi-lobular acini that continued to proliferate at an abnormally late stage compared to control acini. Immunostaining of the cell-cell junctions of WAVE2-KD acini revealed weak and heterogeneous E-cadherin staining despite little change in actin filament localization to the same junctions. Analysis of cadherin expression demonstrated a decrease in E-cadherin and an increase in N-cadherin protein and mRNA abundance in total cell lysates. In addition, WAVE2-KD cells exhibited an increase in the mRNA levels of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated transcription factor Twist1. KD of Twist1 expression in WAVE2-KD cells reversed the cadherin switching and completely rescued the aberrant 3D morphological phenotype. Activity of the WAVE2 complex binding partner Abl kinase was also increased in WAVE2-KD cells, as assessed by tyrosine phosphorylation of the Abl substrate CrkL.

APT blockade of OPN in MB231 decreased Bmi1 protein twofold (P < .05). Aptamer-treated cells were significantly decreased in cell migration and wound closure in the scratch wound-assay (P < .001). CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that OPN extracellular binding to MB231 activates an autocrine MAPK intracellular signaling pathway resulting in Twist activation and promoting Bmi1 expression to further EMT initiation and cellular migration. Our results elucidate a previously undescribed role for OPN as a prime regulator of EMT in human breast cancer cells.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"23990016","pmcid":null,"title":"Expression of E-cadherin, Twist, and p53 and their prognostic value in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma.","authors":["Fan CC","Wang TY","Cheng YA","Jiang SS","Cheng CW","Lee AY","Kao TY"],"grantIds":["102A1-CA-PP-08"],"grantAgencies":["NCI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology","journalShort":"J.

However, discrepancies still exist in the relationship between the expression of an epithelial marker E-cadherin and predicting short survival of patients in many types of cancer. In this study, we aimed to determine the levels of E-cadherin, Twist, and p53 in tumor tissues from patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and their clinical significances. METHODS: The protein expression of 112 OSCC tumor and 16 benign tissues was examined by immunohistochemistry staining. Overall survival rates of 112 OSCC patients were measured using Kaplan-Meier estimates and the log-rank tests. RESULTS: E-cadherin and p53 downregulation were found in 70 of 112 (62.5 %) and 66 of 112 (59.0 %), respectively, and Twist overexpression was found in 72 of 112 (64.3 %) studied cases of OSCC patients. Expression of E-cadherin was significantly associated with tumor location (P = 0.004) and mortality (P = 0.010). Patients with lower E-cadherin expression (P = 0.024), betel quid chewing (P = 0.006), smoking (P = 0.001), tumor size >2 cm (P = 0.001), advanced tumor stage (P = 0.043), and recurrence (P < 0.001) exhibited a poorer outcome. Multivariate analysis showed that E-cadherin is an independent marker for survival prediction. Additionally, low E-cadherin expression is significantly correlated with low p53 expression. CONCLUSIONS: E-cadherin is an independent marker for survival prediction in OSCC. Co-evaluation of E-cadherin and p53 expression might be a valuable tool for predicting OSCC patient outcome.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"23982216","pmcid":null,"title":"The twist box domain is required for Twist1-induced prostate cancer metastasis.","authors":["Gajula RP","Chettiar ST","Williams RD","Thiyagarajan S","Kato Y","Aziz K","Wang R","Gandhi N","Wild AT","Vesuna F","Ma J","Salih T","Cades J","Fertig E","Biswal S","Burns TF","Chung CH","Rudin CM","Herman JM","Hales RK","Raman V","An SS","Tran PT"],"grantIds":["P30 CA006973","P50 CA103175","P50CA103175","R01 CA166348","R01CA166348","T32 CA009071","T32CA121937","U54 CA143868","U54CA141868"],"grantAgencies":["NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Molecular cancer research : MCR","journalShort":"Mol.

Structure-function relationships of Twist1 to cancer-related phenotypes are underappreciated, so we studied the requirement of the conserved Twist box domain for metastatic phenotypes in prostate cancer. Evidence suggests that Twist1 is overexpressed in clinical specimens and correlated with aggressive/metastatic disease. Therefore, we examined a transactivation mutant, Twist1-F191G, in prostate cancer cells using in vitro assays, which mimic various stages of metastasis. Twist1 overexpression led to elevated cytoskeletal stiffness and cell traction forces at the migratory edge of cells based on biophysical single-cell measurements. Twist1 conferred additional cellular properties associated with cancer cell metastasis including increased migration, invasion, anoikis resistance, and anchorage-independent growth. The Twist box mutant was defective for these Twist1 phenotypes in vitro. Importantly, we observed a high frequency of Twist1-induced metastatic lung tumors and extrathoracic metastases in vivo using the experimental lung metastasis assay. The Twist box was required for prostate cancer cells to colonize metastatic lung lesions and extrathoracic metastases. Comparative genomic profiling revealed transcriptional programs directed by the Twist box that were associated with cancer progression, such as Hoxa9. Mechanistically, Twist1 bound to the Hoxa9 promoter and positively regulated Hoxa9 expression in prostate cancer cells. Finally, Hoxa9 was important for Twist1-induced cellular phenotypes associated with metastasis. These data suggest that the Twist box domain is required for Twist1 transcriptional programs and prostate cancer metastasis. IMPLICATIONS: Targeting the Twist box domain of Twist1 may effectively limit prostate cancer metastatic potential.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"24051540","pmcid":null,"title":"Interleukin-6-induced Twist and N-cadherin enhance melanoma cell metastasis.","authors":["Na YR","Lee JS","Lee SJ","Seok SH"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Melanoma research","journalShort":"Melanoma Res.","day":28,"month":12,"year":2013,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Antigens, CD","Cadherins","Cell Line, Tumor","Cell Proliferation","Disease Progression","Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition","Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic","Humans","Interleukin-6","Melanoma","Mice","Mice, SCID","Neoplasm Invasiveness","Neoplasm Metastasis","Neoplasm Transplantation","Nuclear Proteins","Phosphorylation","Prognosis","Recombinant Proteins","STAT3 Transcription Factor","Skin Neoplasms","Twist Transcription Factor"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Melanoma patients frequently have elevated serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is correlated with a poor prognosis. IL-6 activates STAT3 phosphorylation, inducing the transcription of genes that regulate tumor cell proliferation and antiapoptosis. In addition, recent evidence suggests that IL-6 induces the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and enhances the invasiveness of tumor cells of epithelial origin. However, it is unknown whether IL-6 affects mesenchymal tumor cells. In this study, we examined the effects of IL-6 on melanoma cells and found that IL-6 can enhance their metastatic potential by regulating the expression of Twist and N-cadherin. First, we confirmed that human melanoma tissues express IL-6 (especially at the lesion site), the IL-6 receptor, N-cadherin, and nuclear Twist. Next, we found that IL-6 induces STAT3 phosphorylation in WM-266-4 human melanoma cells, resulting in transient upregulation of Twist, which is a key regulator of metastasis. Importantly, the expression of N-cadherin, a protein downstream of Twist, was also increased on the cell surface after treatment with IL-6. These cells showed enhanced invasiveness, assessed using an invasion assay, and formed more metastatic nodules in the lungs of NOD-SCID mice after an intravenous injection. Importantly, melanoma cells with knocked-down N-cadherin formed less lung nodules compared with control in the NOD-SCID mouse model. Our data suggest that increased serum IL-6 in cancer patients could increase the invasiveness of melanoma cells and accelerate metastasis. Blocking IL-6 in the melanoma microenvironment may therefore inhibit disease progression.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"23935104","pmcid":null,"title":"The transcription factor Twist1 limits T helper 17 and T follicular helper cell development by repressing the gene encoding the interleukin-6 receptor α chain.","authors":["Pham D","Walline CC","Hollister K","Dent AL","Blum JS","Firulli AB","Kaplan MH"],"grantIds":["P01 AI056097","P30 CA082709","P30 DK090948","R01 AI045515","R01 AI079065","R01 AI079065","R01 AR061392","R01 AR061392","R01AI045515","R21 AI099825","T32 AI060519","T32 HL007910"],"grantAgencies":["NIAID NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIAID NIH HHS","NIAID NIH HHS","NIAID NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAID NIH HHS","NIAID NIH HHS","NIAID NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"The Journal of biological chemistry","journalShort":"J.

However, the molecular mechanisms behind tumorigenesis and dual differentiation have remained elusive. In this study, we investigated whether Twist1 is an essential transcription factor for maintaining tumor-initiating cell properties in synovial sarcoma. First, we identified that Twist1 is overexpressed in most cases of synovial sarcoma (SS) samples as well as in two synovial sarcoma cell lines (HSSYII, SW982). Additionally, Twist1 depletion led to down-regulation of mesenchymal markers and up-regulation of epithelial markers in SS cell lines. The migratory and invasive abilities of SS cell lines were also significantly reduced following the loss of Twist1. These results indicate that Twist1 plays an essential role in the maintenance of mesenchymal character in SS. Furthermore, knock-down of Twist1 induced G1 cycle arrest and apoptosis as well as remarkable reduction in the sphere-forming cell subpopulation and side population cells. Moreover, Twist1 knock-down profoundly inhibited the growth of synovial sarcoma xenograft in nude mice compared to controls indicating that Twist1 is essential for tumor initiating cell properties. To explore transcriptional regulation by Twist1 at the genomic level, Chromatin immunoprecipiation-solexa whole genome sequencing (ChIP-SEQ) and cDNA microarray analysis were performed. Mesenchymal differentiation/proliferation and PDGF related genes were found to be affected by Twist1. Finally, depletion of SS18-SSX fusion oncoprotein by RNA inference induced down-regulation of Twist1, implying that Twist1 is regulated by SS18-SSX. Hence, our results suggest that Twist1 is an essential transcription factor for the maintenance of mesenchymal characters and tumor initiating properties of synovial sarcoma.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"24085799","pmcid":null,"title":"miR-720 inhibits tumor invasion and migration in breast cancer by targeting TWIST1.","authors":["Li LZ","Zhang CZ","Liu LL","Yi C","Lu SX","Zhou X","Zhang ZJ","Peng YH","Yang YZ","Yun JP"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Carcinogenesis","journalShort":"Carcinogenesis","day":3,"month":2,"year":2014,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Apoptosis","Blotting, Western","Breast Neoplasms","Cell Movement","Cell Proliferation","Female","Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic","Humans","Immunoenzyme Techniques","Lung Neoplasms","Lymphatic Metastasis","Mice","Mice, Inbred BALB C","Mice, Nude","MicroRNAs","Neoplasm Invasiveness","Nuclear Proteins","RNA, Messenger","Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction","Retrospective Studies","Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction","Tumor Cells, Cultured","Twist Transcription Factor"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among females, with tumor metastasis being primarily responsible for breast cancer-associated mortality. Current literatures have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) are implicated in tumor metastasis. In this study, we found that the expression of miR-720 was significantly downregulated in primary breast cancer, with greater downregulation in metastatic tumors. Statistical analysis of 105 cases of primary human breast cancer demonstrated that decreased expression of miR-720 was correlated with lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, reexpression of miR-720 in breast cancer cells remarkably inhibited cell invasiveness and migration both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, downregulation of TWIST1, a promoter of metastasis that was identified as a direct functional target of miR-720, was attributed to the inhibition of metastasis. Consistent with the reduced TWIST1 levels in breast cancer, reexpression of miR-720 upregulated epithelial markers (E-cadherin and β-catenin) and downregulated mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, fibronectin, vimentin and matrix metalloproteinase-2). Expression of miR-720 was inversely associated with TWIST1 in human breast cancer tissues. Knockdown of TWIST1 expression by small interfering RNA exhibited similar effects to reintroduction of miR-720, whereas overexpression of TWIST1 (without the 3'-untranslated region) abrogated miR-720-mediated metastasis inhibition. Collectively, our data indicate that miR-720 is frequently decreased in breast cancer and manifests antimetastatic activity by downregulating TWIST1, presenting a novel mechanism of miRNA-mediated regulation of tumor metastasis.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"24002805","pmcid":null,"title":"MicroRNA-106b modulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition by targeting TWIST1 in invasive endometrial cancer cell lines.","authors":["Dong P","Kaneuchi M","Watari H","Sudo S","Sakuragi N"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Molecular carcinogenesis","journalShort":"Mol.

In this study, we sought to explore the role of TWIST1 in inducing EMT in representative type II EC cell lines, and to determine the miRNAs involved in regulating TWIST1 gene expression. Functional analysis suggested that TWIST1 contributes to the EMT phenotypes of EC cells, as evidenced by the acquisition of fibroblast-like properties, enhanced invasiveness, and induction of an EN-switch (downregulation of epithelial marker E-cadherin and upregulation of mesenchymal marker N-cadherin). Conversely, silencing of TWIST1 by siRNA inhibited cell invasion and the mesenchymal phenotype, which was accompanied by a reversion of the EN-switch. We also observed a novel post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism of TWIST1 expression mediated by miR-106b via its direct interaction with TWIST1 mRNAs at the 3'-untranslated region.

To overcome this issue, we aimed to establish adequate ex vivo expansion protocols and identify repair modulators of cellular senescence. The senescence repair circuit of hypoxia-preconditioned senescent EPCs (hyp-old EPCs) was examined in an effort to enhance their regenerative potential. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Long-term culturing of EPCs in normoxic conditions markedly induced the expression of p21, whereas siRNA targeting of p21 in old EPCs significantly enhanced the proliferation potential of cells. Hyp-old EPCs displayed increased hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and TWIST expression. siRNA inhibition of TWIST, a target molecule of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, markedly upregulated the expression of p21 in hyp-old EPCs by reprogramming cell-cycle regulatory proteins. In a hindlimb model of ischemia, the transplantation of hyp-old EPCs enhanced the blood flow ratio and capillary density, improved cellular proliferation and cell survival at ischemic sites, and augmented the secretion of pivotal tissue angiogenic cytokines. It has been previously demonstrated that the restoration of old EPCs from a senescent state by hypoxia preconditioning is tightly mediated by the downregulation of p21 via the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α-TWIST axis. CONCLUSIONS: This study introduces ex vivo expansion protocols involving hypoxic preconditioning that are suitable for efficiently expanding old EPCs without senescence through modulation of the hypoxia-induced hypoxia-inducible factor-1α-TWIST-p21 axis.

The p63 and its isoforms (TA and ∆N), PARD3, E-cadherin and β-catenin were also assessed transcriptomically by q-PCR and EMT players like TWIST1, ZEB1, MMP9 and micro-RNA 205 were searched in gene expression microarrays. Oral epithelium demonstrating impairment in progressive maturation in oral sub-mucous fibrosis concomitantly experienced an increase in basement membrane thickness and collagen deposition along with alteration in target molecular expressions. In comparison to non-dysplastic conditions dysplastic stages exhibited significant increase in p63 and p63∆N expressions whereas, E-cadherin and β-catenin exhibited loss from the membrane with concurrent increase in cytoplasm. Further the N-cadherin and TWIST were gained remarkably along with the appearance of nuclear accumulation features of β-catenin.

In the joint meta-analyses, 15 loci passed genome-wide significance (P<5×10(-8)) for the combined phenotype of IS or CAD and 17 loci passed genome-wide significance for LAS or CAD. Because these loci had prior evidence for genome-wide significance for CAD, we specifically analyzed the respective signals for IS and LAS and found evidence for association at chr12q24/SH2B3 (PIS=1.62×10(-7)) and ABO (PIS=2.6×10(-4)), as well as at HDAC9 (PLAS=2.32×10(-12)), 9p21 (PLAS=3.70×10(-6)), RAI1-PEMT-RASD1 (PLAS=2.69×10(-5)), EDNRA (PLAS=7.29×10(-4)), and CYP17A1-CNNM2-NT5C2 (PLAS=4.9×10(-4)). CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate substantial overlap in the genetic risk of IS and particularly the LAS subtype with CAD.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"24220291","pmcid":null,"title":"Identification of KLF17 as a novel epithelial to mesenchymal transition inducer via direct activation of TWIST1 in endometrioid endometrial cancer.","authors":["Dong P","Kaneuchi M","Xiong Y","Cao L","Cai M","Liu X","Guo SW","Ju J","Jia N","Konno Y","Watari H","Hosaka M","Sudo S","Sakuragi N"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Carcinogenesis","journalShort":"Carcinogenesis","day":8,"month":4,"year":2014,"meshHeadings":["Base Sequence","Cell Line, Tumor","DNA Primers","Endometrial Neoplasms","Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition","Female","Humans","Nuclear Proteins","Transcription Factors","Twist Transcription Factor"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Krüppel-like factor 17 (KLF17), a member of the KLF transcription factor family, has been shown to inhibit the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor growth. However, the expression, the cellular function and the mechanism of KLF17 in endometrioid endometrial cancer (EEC; a dominant type of endometrial cancer) remain elusive. Here, we report that among the KLF family members, KLF17 was consistently upregulated in EEC cell lines compared with immortalized endometrial epithelial cells. Overexpression of KLF17 in EEC cell lines induced EMT and promoted cell invasion and drug resistance, resulting in increased expression of TWIST1. In contrast, KLF17 suppression reversed EMT, diminished cell invasion, restored drug sensitivity and suppressed TWIST1 expression. Luciferase assays, site-directed mutagenesis and transcription factor DNA-binding analysis demonstrated that KLF17 transactivates TWIST1 expression by directly binding to the TWIST1 promoter. Knockdown of TWIST1 prevented KLF17-induced EMT. Consistent with these results, both KLF17 and TWIST1 levels were found to be elevated in EECs compared with normal tissues. KLF17 expression positively correlated with tumor grade but inversely correlated with estrogen and progesterone receptor expression. Thus, KLF17 may have an oncogenic role during EEC progression via initiating EMT through the regulation of TWIST1.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"24148247","pmcid":null,"title":"miR-181a-Twist1 pathway in the chemoresistance of tongue squamous cell carcinoma.","authors":["Liu M","Wang J","Huang H","Hou J","Zhang B","Wang A"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Biochemical and biophysical research communications","journalShort":"Biochem.

In recent studies, a crucial link has been discovered between the acquisition of metastatic traits and tumour-initiating abilities in cancer cells during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Herein, we demonstrated that the ectopic expression of TWIST1, the EMT regulator, in HNSCC FaDu cells triggered EMT and resulted in the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype. Moreover, FaDu-pFLAG-TWIST1 cancer cell populations that were induced to EMT displayed an increased proportion of cells with the CD44 marker, which is associated with tumour initiation. Interestingly, we found that emodin treatment reduced the tumour-initiating abilities and inhibited cell migration and invasion in FaDu-pFLAG-TWIST1 cells. Emodin directly inhibited TWIST1 expression, upregulated E-cadherin mRNA and protein expression, and downregulated vimentin mRNA and protein expression. Moreover, we found that emodin inhibited TWIST1 binding to the E-cadherin promoter and repressed E-cadherin transcription activity. We also found that emodin inhibited TWIST1-induced EMT by inhibiting the β-catenin and Akt pathways. More interestingly, emodin significantly inhibited TWIST1-induced invasion in vivo. Therefore, emodin might be applicable to anticancer therapy and could be a potential new therapeutic drug for HNSCC.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"24288553","pmcid":"3830792","title":"Overexpression of HIF-2α, TWIST, and CXCR4 is associated with lymph node metastasis in papillary thyroid carcinoma.","authors":["Wang N","Luo HJ","Yin GB","Dong CR","Xu M","Chen GG","Liu ZM"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Clinical & developmental immunology","journalShort":"Clin.

The objective of this study was to identify functional biomarkers that are predictive of OSCC progression to metastasis. METHODS: The expression profile of a network of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes was investigated in a large cohort of patients with progressive OSCC using a complimentary DNA microarray platform coupled to quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical analyses. Therapeutic potential was investigated in vitro and in vivo using an orthotopic mouse model of metastatic OSCC growing in the tongue microenvironment. RESULTS: Among deregulated EMT genes, the Twist-related protein 1 (TWIST1) transcription factor and several of its regulated genes were significantly overexpressed across advanced stages of OSCC. This result was corroborated by the clinical observation that Twist1 up-regulation predicted the occurrence of lymph node and lung metastases as well as poor patient survival. In support of Twist1 as a driver of OSCC progression, the up-regulation of Twist1 was observed in cells isolated from patients with metastatic OSCC. The inhibition of Twist1 in these metastatic cells induced a potent inhibition of cell invasiveness in vitro as well as progression in vivo.

The angiopoietin (Ang)-Tie2 pathway is known to control vascular permeability. However, the mechanism by which the expression of Tie2 is regulated to control vascular permeability has not been fully elucidated. Here we show that transcription factor Twist1 modulates pulmonary vascular leakage by altering the expression of Tie2 in a context-dependent way. Twist1 knockdown in cultured human lung microvascular endothelial cells decreases Tie2 expression and phosphorylation and increases RhoA activity, which disrupts cell-cell junctional integrity and increases vascular permeability in vitro. In physiological conditions, where Ang1 is dominant, pulmonary vascular permeability is elevated in the Tie2-specific Twist1 knockout mice. However, depletion of Twist1 and resultant suppression of Tie2 expression prevent increase in vascular permeability in an endotoxin-induced lung injury model, where the balance of Angs shifts toward Ang2. These results suggest that Twist1-Tie2-Angs signaling is important for controlling vascular permeability and modulation of this mechanism may lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches for pulmonary edema and other diseases caused by abnormal vascular permeability.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"24117170","pmcid":null,"title":"Differential expression and activation of epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (EGFR1), ERK, AKT, STAT3, and TWIST1 in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).","authors":["Gorgisen G","Ozes D","Pehlivanoglu S","Erdogan A","Dertsiz L","Ozbilim G","Ozbudak IH","Savas B","Ozes ON"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Experimental lung research","journalShort":"Exp.

Even though some patients respond to these TKI, subsequent studies reveal that this is not the case for all nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. In this study, we determine whether activation and expression levels of EGFR1, ERK, AKT, STAT3, and TWIST1 are dependent on the activating mutations of EGFR1.

Detection of the expression of these biomarkers may provide a valuable reference for the study of breast carcinoma progression, metastasis and for the judgment of the biological behavior of the carcinoma.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"24469992","pmcid":null,"title":"Kindlin-3 enhances breast cancer progression and metastasis by activating Twist-mediated angiogenesis.","authors":["Sossey-Alaoui K","Pluskota E","Davuluri G","Bialkowska K","Das M","Szpak D","Lindner DJ","Downs-Kelly E","Thompson CL","Plow EF"],"grantIds":["P01-HL-073311","P30-CA-43703","R01 HL096062","R01-HL-096062"],"grantAgencies":["NHLBI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology","journalShort":"FASEB J.","day":5,"month":5,"year":2014,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Antigens, CD29","Breast Neoplasms","Cell Line, Tumor","Disease Progression","Female","Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic","Humans","Membrane Proteins","Mice","Mice, SCID","Neoplasm Metastasis","Neoplasm Proteins","Neovascularization, Pathologic","Nuclear Proteins","Protein Structure, Tertiary","Receptor, ErbB-2","Receptors, Estrogen","Receptors, Progesterone","Twist Transcription Factor","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"The FERM domain containing protein Kindlin-3 has been recognized as a major regulator of integrin function in hematopoietic cells, but its role in neoplasia is totally unknown. We have examined the relationship between Kindlin-3 and breast cancer in mouse models and human tissues. Human breast tumors showed a ∼7-fold elevation in Kindlin-3 mRNA compared with nonneoplastic tissue by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Kindlin-3 overexpression in a breast cancer cell line increased primary tumor growth and lung metastasis by 2.5- and 3-fold, respectively, when implanted into mice compared with cells expressing vector alone. Mechanistically, the Kindlin-3-overexpressing cells displayed a 2.2-fold increase in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion and enhanced β1 integrin activation. Increased VEGF secretion resulted from enhanced production of Twist, a transcription factor that promotes tumor angiogenesis. Knockdown of Twist diminished VEGF production, and knockdown of β1 integrins diminished Twist and VEGF production by Kindlin-3-overexpressing cells, while nontargeting small interfering RNA had no effect on expression of these gene products. Thus, Kindlin-3 influences breast cancer progression by influencing the crosstalk between β1 integrins and Twist to increase VEGF production.

However, a detailed underlying mechanism by which EGF induces EMT and prostate cancer cell progression remained to be answered. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and TWIST1 are transcription factors implicated in EMT and cancer metastasis. The purpose of this study is to determine the underlying mechanism of EGF-induced TWIST1 expression and prostate cancer invasion. METHODS: siRNAs were used to silence genes. Immunoblotting, quantitative RT-PCR and immunofluorescence analysis were used to examine protein or mRNA expression. Modified Boyden chamber and invasion assay kit with Matrigel-coated inserts were used to determine prostate cancer cell migration and invasion, respectively. RESULTS: We observed that EGF induced HIF-1α expression and morphological change of prostate cancer epithelial cells to mesenchymal cells. Silencing HIF-1α expression dramatically reduced EGF-induced TWIST1 expression and prostate cancer cell EMT. Conversely, transfection of the cells with HIF-1α siRNA reversed the reduced E-cadherin expression by EGF. Pretreatment of the cells with pharmacological inhibitors of reactive oxygen species [ROS, N-acetylcysteine (NAC)] and STAT3 (WP1066) but not p38 MAPK (SB203580) significantly reduced EGF-induced HIF-1α mRNA and protein expression. Further, pretreatment of the cells with NAC attenuated EGF-induced STAT3 phosphorylation.

In this study, we profiled miRNAs differentially expressed in chemoresistant OS, with a focus to identify miRNAs that regulate TWIST expression and OS chemoresistance. METHODS: OS patients who showed <90% tumor necrosis after neochemotherapy were defined as poor responders (chemoresistant), and those who showed ≥90% tumor necrosis were defined as good responders (control). miRNA microarray analysis was carried out with a discovery cohort (n = 12) of age-, sex- and tumor stage-matched chemoresistant and control OS patients. RESULTS: Among the up-regulated miRNAs in chemoresistant OS samples, miR-33a was verified to down-regulate TWIST expression, which was supported by an inverse miRNA-33a/TWIST expression trend in the validation cohort (n = 70), target-sequence-specific inhibition of TWIST-3' untranslated region-luciferase reporter activity by miR-33a, and alteration of TWIST expression by overexpression or inhibition of miR-33a in human OS cell lines. In Saos-2 cells treated with cisplatin, inhibition of miR-33a by antagomir-33a markedly increased cell apoptosis, which was enhanced by overexpression of TWIST. The apoptosis-inducing effect of TWIST overexpression was reversed by overexpression of miR-33a. In MG-63 cells, overexpression of miR-33a significantly decreased cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis, which was enhanced by knockdown of TWIST. Antagomir-33a significantly increased cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis, which was reversed by knockdown of TWIST. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated in this study that miR-33a is up-regulated in chemoresistant OS and that the miR-33a level is negatively correlated with the TWIST protein level in OS. Our in vitro data indicate that miR-33a promotes OS cell resistance to cisplatin by down-regulating TWIST; on the other hand, inhibition of miR-33a by antagomir-33a enhances cisplatin-induced apoptosis in OS cells by up-regulating TWIST expression.

RESULTS: Positive rates of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, TGF-β1 and Twist were 32.2%, 54.2%, 71.2% and 74.6%, respectively, in prostate cancer tissues and 85.7%, 9.52%, 19.0% and 9.52%, respectively, in cancer-adjacent tissues, with significant differences between the two groups (P<0.05).

As a main regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) mechanism-mediated invasion and metastasis, Twist1 plays an important role through its regulation of E-cadherin expression. However, whether or not Twist2 has the same function in tumour metastasis remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to investigate the expressions and different roles of Twist1 and Twist2 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The expressions of Twist1 and Twist2 in HCC tissue were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. The role of Twist1 and Twist2 in invasiveness was also evaluated in vitro by using HCC cell lines. Twist1 nuclear overexpression is found to be correlated with HCC metastasis, and its expression is negatively correlated with E-cadherin expression in human tissue. Twist2, a Twist1 homology protein, only expresses in the cytoplasm and shows no significant correlation with HCC metastasis. By ectopic transfection of Twist1 and Twist2 into the HCC cells, HepG2 and PLC, Twist1 is able to down-regulate E-cadherin expression and promote matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activation, specifically in MMP2 and MMP9. In functional assays, Twist1 is found to promote invasion in HepG2 and PLC cells, but the invasion ability of the groups is not affected Twist2. Our findings indicate that Twist1 induces HCC invasion via increased activity in MMPs, leading to poor clinical prognoses. The results of this study also demonstrate a novel cogitation in Twist2, which has no effect on HCC invasion and metastasis. Twist1 may contribute to HCC invasion and metastasis and may be used as a novel therapeutic target for the inhibition of HCC metastasis.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"8995765","pmcid":null,"title":"The human H-twist gene is located at 7p21 and encodes a B-HLH protein that is 96% similar to its murine M-twist counterpart.","authors":["Bourgeois P","Stoetzel C","Bolcato-Bellemin AL","Mattei MG","Perrin-Schmitt F"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Mammalian genome : official journal of the International Mammalian Genome Society","journalShort":"Mamm.

Mutations of this locus in humans have been identified as the cause of the craniofacial disorder Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. The Caenorhabditis elegans Twist homolog is required for the development of a subset of the mesoderm. A semidominant allele of the gene that codes for CeTwist, hlh-8, has defects that occur earlier in the mesodermal lineage than a previously studied null allele of the gene. The semidominant allele has a charge change (E29K) in the basic DNA-binding domain of CeTwist. Surprisingly, the mutant protein retains DNA-binding activity as both a homodimer and a heterodimer with its partner E/Daughterless (CeE/DA). However, the mutant protein blocks the activation of the promoter of a target gene. Therefore, the mutant CeTwist may cause cellular defects as a dominant negative protein by binding to target promoters as a homo- or heterodimer and then blocking transcription. Similar phenotypes as those caused by the E29K mutation were observed when amino acid substitutions in the DNA-binding domain that are associated with the human Saethre-Chotzen syndrome were engineered into the C. elegans protein.

Although insertions, deletions, nonsense and missense mutations have been identified, no genotype-phenotype correlation could be found, suggesting that the gene alterations lead to a loss of protein function irrespective of the mutation. To assess this hypothesis, we studied stability, dimerization capacities and subcellular distribution of three types of TWIST mutant. Here, we show that: (i) nonsense mutations resulted in truncated protein instability; (ii) missense mutations involving the helical domains led to a complete loss of H-TWIST heterodimerization with the E12 bHLH protein in the two-hybrid system and dramatically altered the ability of the TWIST protein to localize in the nucleus of COS-transfected cells; and (iii) in-frame insertion or missense mutations within the loop significantly altered dimer formation but not the nuclear location of the protein.

It is thought to be a rare autosomal recessive condition, which, in some patients, presents with additional abnormalities, such as polymicrogyria, mental retardation or anal atresia. A phenotypic overlap of Baller-Gerold and Roberts-SC phocomelia syndrome was noted when a patient with bicoronal synostosis and bilateral radial hypoplasia was found to have premature centromere separation, a finding characteristic of Roberts syndrome [Huson et al.,1990: J Med Genet 27:371-375]. Other cases of presumed Baller-Gerold syndrome were rediagnosed as Fanconi pancytopenia, Rothmund-Thomson syndrome or VACTERL association. These reports led to a narrowed redefinition of Baller-Gerold syndrome based on the exclusion of cytogenetic and hematopoetic abnormalities and the absence of additional malformations in patients with craniosynostosis and preaxial upper limb abnormalities. Here we report on a patient with unilateral radial aplasia and bicoronal synostosis without additional malformations and without chromosome breakage, who fits this narrow definition of Baller-Gerold syndrome. We identified a novel TWIST gene mutation in this patient, a Glu181Stop mutation predicting a premature termination of the protein carboxy-terminal to the helix 2 domain. This report provides further evidence that Baller-Gerold is of heterogeneous cause, and a thorough evaluation is indicated to identify a possibly more specific diagnosis, including Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. This differential diagnosis is of particular importance, as it is an autosomal dominant trait. Therefore, the recurrence risk for parents of an affected child can be 50% if one parent carries the mutation, as opposed to the 25% recurrence risk for autosomal recessive inheritance. Offspring of the affected patient also have a 50% risk to inherit the mutation, while the risk to bear an affected offspring for an autosomal recessive trait is very low.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"10485844","pmcid":null,"title":"Twist is a potential oncogene that inhibits apoptosis.","authors":["Maestro R","Dei Tos AP","Hamamori Y","Krasnokutsky S","Sartorelli V","Kedes L","Doglioni C","Beach DH","Hannon GJ"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Genes & development","journalShort":"Genes Dev.","day":1,"month":9,"year":1999,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Apoptosis","Cell Division","Cell Line","Cell Transformation, Neoplastic","Fibroblasts","Gene Deletion","Genes, myc","Genes, p53","Genes, ras","Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs","Humans","Mice","Nuclear Proteins","Oncogenes","Rats","Repressor Proteins","Rhabdomyosarcoma","Transcription Factors","Tumor Suppressor Protein p53","Twist Transcription Factor"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Oncogene activation increases susceptibility to apoptosis. Thus, tumorigenesis must depend, in part, on compensating mutations that protect from programmed cell death. A functional screen for cDNAs that could counteract the proapoptotic effects of the myc oncogene identified two related bHLH family members, Twist and Dermo1. Both of these proteins inhibited oncogene- and p53-dependent cell death. Twist expression bypassed p53-induced growth arrest. These effects correlated with an ability of Twist to interfere with activation of a p53-dependent reporter and to impair induction of p53 target genes in response to DNA damage. An underlying explanation for this observation may be provided by the ability of Twist to reduce expression of the ARF tumor suppressor. Thus, Twist may affect p53 indirectly through modulation of the ARF/MDM2/p53 pathway. Consistent with a role as a potential oncoprotein, Twist expression promoted colony formation of E1A/ras-transformed mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) in soft agar. Furthermore, Twist was inappropriately expressed in 50% of rhabdomyosarcomas, a tumor that arises from skeletal muscle precursors that fail to differentiate. Twist is known to block myogenic differentiation. Thus, Twist may play multiple roles in the formation of rhabdomyosarcomas, halting terminal differentiation, inhibiting apoptosis, and interfering with the p53 tumor-suppressor pathway.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"10465122","pmcid":null,"title":"Identification of a frameshift mutation in the gene TWIST in a family affected with Robinow-Sorauf syndrome.","authors":["Kunz J","Hudler M","Fritz B"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Journal of medical genetics","journalShort":"J.

Our results demonstrate that Dermo-1 caused changes similar to Twist in the osteogenic properties of osteoblastic cells, such as morphology, bone marker gene expression, and biochemical response to cytokines.

We speculate that expression of Twist and Dermo-1 maintains cells in an osteoprogenitor or preosteoblast-like state, respectively, and prevents premature or ectopic osteoblast differentiation. Therefore, Twist and Dermo-1 must be sequentially downregulated in order to initiate the cascade of events responsible for osteogenic cell differentiation.

Analysis of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick-end labelling (TUNEL) demonstrated increased osteoblast and osteocyte apoptosis in coronal sutures from two SCS patients with nonsense mutations (Y103X and Q109X) that result in the synthesis of bHLH-truncated proteins, and one patient with a missense mutation in the basic domain (R118C) that abolishes Twist DNA binding. To assess the mechanisms involved, we studied osteoblast apoptosis in mutant (M-Tw) calvarial cells bearing the Y103X mutation resulting in decreased Twist mRNA and protein levels. M-Tw cells cultured in low serum conditions showed enhanced DNA fragmentation compared to normal (Nl) age-matched calvarial cells. Biochemical analysis showed increased activity of initiator caspases-2 and -8 and downstream effector caspases-3, -6 and -7 in mutant osteoblasts. Caspase-2 was upstream of caspase-8 and effector caspases-3, -6 and -7 because their activities were suppressed by a specific caspase-2 inhibitor. M-Tw osteoblasts also showed increased cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. However, the activity of the downstream effector caspase-9 was not increased due to overexpression of the antagonist protein Hsp70. Detection of differentially expressed genes using cDNA expression array revealed increased Bax and TNFalpha mRNA levels in M-Tw compared to Nl cells, a finding confirmed by RT-PCR and western blot analyses. Neutralization of TNFalpha overexpression using anti-TNFalpha or anti-TNF receptor 1 antibodies abolished the increased activity of caspase-2, caspase-8 and caspases-3, -6 and -7 in M-Tw osteoblasts. These studies provide novel evidence that Twist haploinsufficiency in SCS promotes osteoblast apoptosis by a TNFalpha-caspase-2-caspase-8-caspases-3, -6, -7 cascade, and uncover a molecular mechanism in which Twist plays an anti-apoptotic role in human calvarial osteoblasts.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"15555546","pmcid":null,"title":"Snail regulates p21(WAF/CIP1) expression in cooperation with E2A and Twist.","authors":["Takahashi E","Funato N","Higashihori N","Hata Y","Gridley T","Nakamura M"],"grantIds":["HD34883"],"grantAgencies":["NICHD NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Biochemical and biophysical research communications","journalShort":"Biochem.

Controls are infants born in Maryland without any known birth defects (n = 182). Odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.

There were no elevated risks for craniosynostosis related to maternal or paternal smoking or maternal vitamin usage. Case mothers consumed less alcohol (OR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.17-0.85) and had less education than control mothers ( < 0.001).

We identified three novel intragenic mutations and six deletions in our patients by using a new strategy to screen for TWIST mutations. We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with subsequent sequencing to identify point mutations and small insertions or deletions in the coding region, and real-time PCR-based gene dosage analysis to identify large deletions encompassing the gene, with confirmation by microsatellite and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses. The size of the deletions can also be analyzed by using the gene dosage assay with \"PCR walking\" across the critical region.

While it is considered as one of the most effective anticancer drugs, treatment failure often occurs due to development of acquired resistance. Therefore, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of drug resistance. Although it is generally believed that taxol induces cell death through interfering with microtubules leading to mitotic arrest, recent evidence has suggested that taxol-induced cell death also occurs through pathways independent of either microtubule or mitotic arrest. In this study, we report the identification of a novel role for TWIST, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, which plays a central role in cell type determination and differentiation, during generation of acquired resistance to taxol in a nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line, HNE1-T3, using comparative genome hybridization (CGH) and subsequent RT-PCR and Western blotting. We found that upregulation of TWIST was associated with cellular resistance to taxol but not other drugs with different mechanisms of action. The fact that increased TWIST protein levels were also associated with another microtubule-targeting anticancer drug, vincristine, in four types of human cancer including nasopharyngeal, bladder, ovarian and prostate, indicates that it may play a central role in the resistance to microtubule-disrupting agents. In addition, ectopic expression of TWIST into human cancer cells also led to increased resistance to both taxol and vincristine. Our results indicate a novel mechanism that leads to resistance to microtubule-disrupting anticancer drugs through upregulation of TWIST. Our evidence provides a therapeutic strategy to overcome acquired resistance through inactivation of TWIST expression in human cancer.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"12477932","pmcid":null,"title":"Generation and initial analysis of more than 15,000 full-length human and mouse cDNA sequences.","authors":["Strausberg RL","Feingold EA","Grouse LH","Derge JG","Klausner RD","Collins FS","Wagner L","Shenmen CM","Schuler GD","Altschul SF","Zeeberg B","Buetow KH","Schaefer CF","Bhat NK","Hopkins RF","Jordan H","Moore T","Max SI","Wang J","Hsieh F","Diatchenko L","Marusina K","Farmer AA","Rubin GM","Hong L","Stapleton M","Soares MB","Bonaldo MF","Casavant TL","Scheetz TE","Brownstein MJ","Usdin TB","Toshiyuki S","Carninci P","Prange C","Raha SS","Loquellano NA","Peters GJ","Abramson RD","Mullahy SJ","Bosak SA","McEwan PJ","McKernan KJ","Malek JA","Gunaratne PH","Richards S","Worley KC","Hale S","Garcia AM","Gay LJ","Hulyk SW","Villalon DK","Muzny DM","Sodergren EJ","Lu X","Gibbs RA","Fahey J","Helton E","Ketteman M","Madan A","Rodrigues S","Sanchez A","Whiting M","Madan A","Young AC","Shevchenko Y","Bouffard GG","Blakesley RW","Touchman JW","Green ED","Dickson MC","Rodriguez AC","Grimwood J","Schmutz J","Myers RM","Butterfield YS","Krzywinski MI","Skalska U","Smailus DE","Schnerch A","Schein JE","Jones SJ","Marra MA","Mammalian Gene Collection Program Team"],"grantIds":["U54 HG003273"],"grantAgencies":["NHGRI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","journalShort":"Proc.

Suppression of Twist expression in highly metastatic mammary carcinoma cells specifically inhibits their ability to metastasize from the mammary gland to the lung. Ectopic expression of Twist results in loss of E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, activation of mesenchymal markers, and induction of cell motility, suggesting that Twist contributes to metastasis by promoting an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).

We report here a previously undescribed mechanism involved in the altered osteoblastogenesis in SCS. Cranial osteoblasts from an SCS patient with a Twist mutation causing basic helix-loop-helix deletion exhibited decreased expression of E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl compared with wild-type osteoblasts. This was associated with decreased ubiquitin-mediated degradation of phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase (PI3K) and increased PI3K expression and PI3K/Akt signaling. Increased PI3K immunoreactivity was also found in osteoblasts in histological sections of affected cranial sutures from SCS patients. Transfection with Twist or Cbl abolished the increased PI3K/Akt signaling in Twist mutant osteoblasts. Forced overexpression of Cbl did not correct the altered expression of osteoblast differentiation markers in Twist mutant cells. In contrast, pharmacological inhibition of PI3K/Akt, but not ERK signaling, corrected the increased cell growth in Twist mutant osteoblasts. The results show that Twist haploinsufficiency results in decreased Cbl-mediated PI3K degradation in osteoblasts, causing PI3K accumulation and activation of PI3K/Akt-dependent osteoblast growth. This provides genetic and biochemical evidence for a role for Cbl-mediated PI3K signaling in the altered osteoblast phenotype induced by Twist haploinsufficiency in SCS.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"15607966","pmcid":null,"title":"Oncogenic cooperation between H-Twist and N-Myc overrides failsafe programs in cancer cells.","authors":["Valsesia-Wittmann S","Magdeleine M","Dupasquier S","Garin E","Jallas AC","Combaret V","Krause A","Leissner P","Puisieux A"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Cancer cell","journalShort":"Cancer Cell","day":20,"month":12,"year":2004,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Apoptosis","Blotting, Northern","Blotting, Western","Caspase 3","Caspase 8","Caspases","Cell Cycle Proteins","Cell Line, Tumor","Cell Transformation, Neoplastic","Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16","Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21","Fibroblasts","Flow Cytometry","Gene Amplification","Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic","Humans","In Situ Nick-End Labeling","Mice","Neuroblastoma","Nuclear Proteins","Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis","Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc","Proto-Oncogenes","RNA, Small Interfering","Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction","Transcription Factors","Transfection","Tumor Stem Cell Assay","Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF","Tumor Suppressor Protein p53","Twist Transcription Factor"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"N-Myc oncogene amplification is a frequent event in neuroblastoma and is strongly correlated with advanced disease stage and treatment failure.

To further delineate a possible oncogenic role for TWIST in the central nervous system (CNS), we analyzed TWIST expression in human gliomas and normal brain by using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, Northern blot analysis, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. TWIST expression was detected in the large majority of human glioma-derived cell lines and human gliomas examined. Levels of TWIST mRNA were associated with the highest grade gliomas, and increased TWIST expression accompanied transition from low grade to high grade in vivo, suggesting a role for TWIST in promoting malignant progression. In accord, elevated TWIST mRNA abundance preceded the spontaneous malignant transformation of cultured mouse astrocytes hemizygous for p53. Overexpression of TWIST protein in a human glioma cell line significantly enhanced tumor cell invasion, a hallmark of high-grade gliomas.

We investigated the localization of Twist in PDL and compared the expression of Twist and osteoblast-related genes in PDL cells with those in osteoblast-like cells in the presence or absence of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2. Histochemical analysis showed that Twist was expressed along alveolar bone surface in PDL.

Interestingly, unlike in osteoblast-like cells, Twist expression was upregulated by BMP-2 in PDL cells. We transiently knocked down Twist gene in PDL cells using a short interference RNA expression vector (siTwist) and found that ALP, osteopontin (OPN), bone sialoprotein (BSP) genes expression and basal level of ALP activity were slightly increased, whereas Runx2 and OCN genes were not affected.

In this study, we have shown a potential novel target, TWIST, a highly conserved bHLH transcription factor, in the treatment of prostate cancer. Using malignant and nonmalignant prostate tissues, we found that TWIST expression was highly expressed in the majority (90%) of prostate cancer tissues but only in a small percentage (6.7%) of benign prostate hyperplasia. In addition, the TWIST expression levels were positively correlated with Gleason grading and metastasis, indicating its role in the development and progression of prostate cancer. Furthermore, down-regulation of TWIST through small interfering RNA in androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines, DU145 and PC3, resulted in increased sensitivity to the anticancer drug taxol-induced cell death which was associated with decreased Bcl/Bax ratio, leading to activation of the apoptosis pathway. More importantly, inactivation of TWIST suppressed migration and invasion abilities of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells, which was correlated with induction of E-cadherin expression as well as morphologic and molecular changes associated with mesenchymal to epithelial transition. These results were further confirmed on the androgen-dependent LNCaP cells ectopically expressing the TWIST protein.

Twist1 has been shown to play both positive and negative roles in mesenchymal specification and differentiation, and here we show that the activity of Twist1 is dependent on its dimer partner. Twist1 forms both homodimers (T/T) and heterodimers with E2A E proteins (T/E) and the relative level of Twist1 to the HLH inhibitor Id proteins determines which dimer forms. On the basis of the expression patterns of Twist1 and Id1 within the cranial sutures, we hypothesized that Twist1 forms homodimers in the osteogenic fronts and T/E heterodimers in the mid-sutures. In support of this hypothesis, we have found that genes regulated by T/T homodimers, such as FGFR2 and periostin, are expressed in the osteogenic fronts, whereas genes regulated by T/E heterodimers, such as thrombospondin-1, are expressed in the mid-sutures. The ratio between these dimers is altered in the sutures of Twist1+/- mice, favoring an increase in homodimers and an expansion of the osteogenic fronts. Of interest, the T/T to T/E ratio is greater in the coronal versus the sagittal suture, and this finding may contribute to making the coronal suture more susceptible to fusion due to TWIST haploinsufficiency. Importantly, we were able to inhibit suture fusion in Twist1+/- mice by modulating the balance between these dimers toward T/E formation, by either increasing the expression of E2A E12 or by decreasing Id expression. Therefore, we have identified dimer partner selection as an important mediator of Twist1 function and provide a mechanistic understanding of craniosynostosis due to TWIST haploinsufficiency.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"16831897","pmcid":"2118370","title":"Twist mediates suppression of inflammation by type I IFNs and Axl.","authors":["Sharif MN","Sosic D","Rothlin CV","Kelly E","Lemke G","Olson EN","Ivashkiv LB"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","journalShort":"J.

Known causes of coronal synostosis include haploinsufficiency of TWIST1 and a gain of function mutation in MSX2.

Primary colorectal cancer (CRC) specimens from 319 patients, corresponding normal colorectal nontumorous mucosa from 251 patients with cancer, and colorectal adenomas from 189 patients were used. Methylation and expression levels of TWIST1 were compared with clinicopathologic features. The TWIST1 methylation level was higher in colorectal adenoma and cancer than in normal colorectal mucosa.

To clarify involvement of Twist expression in pancreatic cancer, we used quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and examined Twist expression in pancreatic cancer, IPMN, and non-neoplastic pancreas using bulk tissues (11 cancers, 18 IPMNs, and 15 non-neoplastic pancreata), microdissected cells (cancer from 22 sections, IPMN from 19 sections, PanIN from 6 sections, and pancreatitis-affected epithelial cells from 14 sections), and pancreatic juice (16 from cancer, 28 from IPMN, and 17 from pancreatitis).

In order to better understand the biology behind this disease we used a genome wide characterization of loss of heterozygosity and amplification by Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) Array analysis to point out chromosome segments linked to EGFR mutations. To do so, we compared genetic profiles between EGFR mutated adenocarcinomas (ADC) and KRAS mutated ADC from 24 women with localized lung cancer. RESULTS: Patterns of alterations were different between EGFR and KRAS mutated tumors and specific chromosomes alterations were linked to the EGFR mutated group. Indeed chromosome regions 14q21.3 (p = 0.027), 7p21.3-p21.2 (p = 0.032), 7p21.3 (p = 0.042) and 7p21.2-7p15.3 (p = 0.043) were found significantly amplified in EGFR mutated tumors. Within those regions 3 genes are of special interest ITGB8, HDAC9 and TWIST1. Moreover, homozygous deletions at CDKN2A and LOH at RB1 were identified in EGFR mutated tumors. We therefore tested the existence of a link between EGFR mutation, CDKN2A homozygous deletion and cyclin amplification in a larger series of tumors. Indeed, in a series of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (n = 98) we showed that homozygous deletions at CDKN2A were linked to EGFR mutations and absence of smoking whereas cyclin amplifications (CCNE1 and CCND1) were associated to TP53 mutations and smoking habit. CONCLUSION: All together, our results show that genome wide patterns of alteration differ between EGFR and KRAS mutated lung ADC, describe two models of oncogenic cooperation involving either EGFR mutation and CDKN2A deletion or cyclin amplification and TP53 inactivating mutations and identified new chromosome regions at 7p and 14q associated to EGFR mutations in lung cancer.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"16322226","pmcid":null,"title":"Twist overexpression induces in vivo angiogenesis and correlates with chromosomal instability in breast cancer.","authors":["Mironchik Y","Winnard PT","Vesuna F","Kato Y","Wildes F","Pathak AP","Kominsky S","Artemov D","Bhujwalla Z","Van Diest P","Burger H","Glackin C","Raman V"],"grantIds":["1R01CA097226","R01 CA097226","R01 CA097226-03"],"grantAgencies":["NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Cancer research","journalShort":"Cancer Res.","day":1,"month":12,"year":2005,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Breast Neoplasms","Capillary Permeability","Cell Growth Processes","Cell Line, Tumor","Cell Movement","Chromosomal Instability","Claudins","Female","Humans","Membrane Proteins","Mesoderm","Mice","Mice, SCID","Neoplasm Invasiveness","Neoplasm Transplantation","Neovascularization, Pathologic","Nuclear Proteins","Transcriptional Activation","Transplantation, Heterologous","Twist Transcription Factor"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Aggressive cancer phenotypes are a manifestation of many different genetic alterations that promote rapid proliferation and metastasis.

In addition, it was observed that MCF-7/Twist cells had increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) synthesis when compared with empty vector control cells. The functional changes induced by VEGF in vivo were analyzed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of MCF-7/Twist-xenografted tumors.

To understand the basis for metastasis, we systematically selected for highly invasive cells from breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and MDA-MB-453, with moderate to low invasive ability using Boyden chamber invasion assay. The four-cycle selected invasive lines, named MCF7-I4 and MDA-MB-453-I4, respectively, displayed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and dramatically enhanced invasive ability. EMT changes were corroborated with decreased level of E-cadherin and increased vimentin, fibronectin, and beta(1) integrin. Twist, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, and AKT2, a known proto-oncogene, were found to be elevated in the invasive cells compared with the parental. Ectopic expression and knockdown of Twist by short interference RNA resulted in significant increase and reduction, respectively, of AKT2 protein and mRNA expression. Twist bound to E-box elements on AKT2 promoter and enhanced its transcriptional activity. Moreover, silencing AKT2 decreased Twist-promoted migration, invasion, and paclitaxel resistance. Reintroducing AKT2 largely rescued the phenotype resulted from knockdown of Twist in I4 cells, suggesting that AKT2 is a downstream target and functional mediator of Twist. Finally, we observed a 68.8% correlation of elevated Twist and AKT2 expression in late-stage breast cancers as oppose to 13% in early-stage breast cancers.

LMP1 could induce EMT and its associated cell motility and invasiveness in a cell culture model, whereas expression of Twist small interfering RNA reversed LMP1-induced EMT. In diverse EBV-infected cell lines, expression of Twist correlates with expression of LMP1. Dominant-negative LMP1 could suppress Twist expression in EBV-positive cells, whereas LMP1 could induce Twist in EBV-negative nasopharyngeal cells. LMP1 signals through the nuclear factor-kappaB pathway, and an IkappaB superrepressor inhibited induction of Twist by LMP1. Finally, in human NPC tissues, expression of Twist and LMP1 is directly correlated and expression of Twist is associated with metastasis clinically.

In syndromic craniosynostosis, there is a highly nonrandom pattern of causative autosomal dominant mutations involving TWIST1 and fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs). Prior to our study, there were no published TWIST1 mutations in the anti-osteogenic C-terminus, recently coined the TWIST Box, which binds and inhibits RUNX2 transactivation. RUNX2 is the principal master switch for osteogenesis. We performed mutational analysis on 164 infants with isolated, single-suture craniosynostosis for mutations in TWIST1, the IgIIIa exon of FGFR1, the IgIIIa and IgIIIc exons of FGFR2, and the Pro250Arg site of FGFR3. We identified two patients with novel TWIST Box mutations: one with isolated sagittal synostosis and one with isolated coronal synostosis. Kress et al. [2006] reported a TWIST Box \"nondisease-causing polymorphism\" in a patient with isolated sagittal synostosis. However, compelling evidence suggests that their and our sequence alterations are pathogenic: (1) a mouse with a mutation of the same residue as our sagittal synostosis patient developed sagittal synostosis, (2) mutation of the same residue precluded TWIST1 interaction with RUNX2, (3) each mutation involved nonconservative amino acid substitutions in highly conserved residues across species, and (4) control chromosomes lacked TWIST Box sequence alterations.

The present study aimed to investigate the prognostic significance of TWIST and to correlate TWIST and E-cadherin expression in prostatic cancer specimens.

These cells are heterogeneous and likely do not exhibit uniform biological behavior. To understand the molecular diversity of disseminated cancer cells that reside in bone marrow, we enriched this cell population and did global gene expression profiling in the context of a prospective clinical trial involving women with clinical stage II/III breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Enrichment of TACSTD1 (EpCAM)-expressing cells from bone marrow of breast cancer patients was achieved using immunomagnetic beads. Gene expression profiles were compared between enriched cell populations and whole bone marrow from 5 normal volunteers and 23 breast cancer patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment. Enriched cells from bone marrow samples of breast cancer patients before treatment or at 1 year follow-up were also analyzed (total of 87 data sets). The expression of transcripts specifically detected in enriched cell populations from breast cancer patients was correlated with 1-year clinical outcome using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR in an independent cohort of bone marrow samples. RESULTS: Analysis of EpCAM-enriched bone marrow cells revealed specific expression of a subgroup of transcripts, including the metastasis regulator, TWIST1. Most transcripts identified, including TWIST1, were not expressed in enriched populations of bone marrow from normal volunteers, suggesting that this expression profile reflects a signature of breast cancer bone marrow micrometastases that persist after chemotherapy. In an independent set of bone marrow samples obtained before any treatment, TWIST1 expression correlated with early disease relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Disseminated breast cancer cells present in bone marrow after chemotherapy possess unique transcriptional signatures. Genes whose expression is overrepresented in these cell populations, such as TWIST1, may prove to be excellent markers of early distant relapse in breast cancer patients.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"17487558","pmcid":null,"title":"Possible involvement of TWIST in enhanced peritoneal metastasis of epithelial ovarian carcinoma.","authors":["Terauchi M","Kajiyama H","Yamashita M","Kato M","Tsukamoto H","Umezu T","Hosono S","Yamamoto E","Shibata K","Ino K","Nawa A","Nagasaka T","Kikkawa F"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Clinical & experimental metastasis","journalShort":"Clin.

To investigate the mechanism by which down-regulation of TWIST leads to inhibition of adhesion to mesothelial cells (MCs), expression of adhesion molecules (CD29, CD44 and CD54) were observed. Moreover, matrix metalloproteinase 2 and membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase, important markers associated with invasive and metastatic potential, were remarkably reduced.

Recently, two studies confirming somatic mosaicism with local expression of an FGFR mutation have been reported. This study investigates whether somatic mosaicism could account for nonsyndromic, single suture craniosynostosis. Eight individuals with single suture craniosynostosis who were negative for known mutations in FGFR1-3 and TWIST after screening in their leucocyte DNA were tested for the presence of pathogenic mutations in suture cell-derived DNA.

DNA from the cultured cells grown to passage 3 was then examined for underlying FGFR and TWIST mutations. No mutations within the exons of the FGFR or TWIST genes studied were identified in any suture cells. This study found no evidence to support the notion that mosaicism for FGFR or TWIST mutations, normally associated with syndromal forms of craniosynostosis, occur in single suture craniosynostosis.

Activation of NF-kappaB blocks PCD induced by numerous triggers, including ligand engagement of tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R) family receptors. The protective activity of NF-kappaB is also crucial for oncogenesis and cancer chemoresistance. Downstream of TNF-Rs, this activity of NF-kappaB has been linked to the suppression of reactive oxygen species and the c-Jun-N-terminal-kinase (JNK) cascade. The mechanism by which NF-kappaB inhibits PCD triggered by chemotherapeutic drugs, however, remains poorly understood. To understand this mechanism, we sought to identify unrecognized protective genes that are regulated by NF-kappaB. Using an unbiased screen, we identified the basic-helix-loop-helix factor Twist-1 as a new mediator of the protective function of NF-kappaB. Twist-1 is an evolutionarily conserved target of NF-kappaB, blocks PCD induced by chemotherapeutic drugs and TNF-alpha in NF-kappaB-deficient cells, and is essential to counter this PCD in cancer cells.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of TWIST on the growth of human epithelial cells. Using two immortalized human prostate epithelial cell lines, we demonstrated that inactivation of TWIST by small RNA technology led to the promotion of cellular senescence and growth arrest, suggesting that TWIST plays a key role in the continuous proliferation of immortalized cells. Over-expression of TWIST, in contrast, resulted in suppression of cellular senescence in response to genotoxic damage and promotion of cell proliferation with DNA damage accumulation, indicating that TWIST promotes genomic instability. In addition, we also found that the TWIST-mediated cellular senescence was regulated through its negative effect on p14(ARF) and subsequent suppression of MDM2/p53 and Chk1/2 DNA damage response pathways. Our results suggest that over-expression of TWIST results in down-regulation of p14(ARF), which leads to the impairment of DNA damage checkpoint in response to genotoxic stress. This negative effect of TWIST on DNA damage response facilitates uncontrolled cell proliferation with genomic instability and tumorigenesis in non-malignant cells.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"17967182","pmcid":"2206053","title":"Identification of a panel of sensitive and specific DNA methylation markers for lung adenocarcinoma.","authors":["Tsou JA","Galler JS","Siegmund KD","Laird PW","Turla S","Cozen W","Hagen JA","Koss MN","Laird-Offringa IA"],"grantIds":["R01 CA119029","R21 CA102247"],"grantAgencies":["NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Molecular cancer","journalShort":"Mol.

Three quarters of lung cancer patients are diagnosed with regionally or distantly disseminated disease; their 5-year survival is only 15%. DNA hypermethylation at promoter CpG islands shows great promise as a cancer-specific marker that would complement visual lung cancer screening tools such as spiral CT, improving early detection. In lung cancer patients, such hypermethylation is detectable in a variety of samples ranging from tumor material to blood and sputum. To date the penetrance of DNA methylation at any single locus has been too low to provide great clinical sensitivity. We used the real-time PCR-based method MethyLight to examine DNA methylation quantitatively at twenty-eight loci in 51 primary human lung adenocarcinomas, 38 adjacent non-tumor lung samples, and 11 lung samples from non-lung cancer patients. RESULTS: We identified thirteen loci showing significant differential DNA methylation levels between tumor and non-tumor lung; eight of these show highly significant hypermethylation in adenocarcinoma: CDH13, CDKN2A EX2, CDX2, HOXA1, OPCML, RASSF1, SFPR1, and TWIST1 (p-value << 0.0001). Using the current tissue collection and 5-fold cross validation, the four most significant loci (CDKN2A EX2, CDX2, HOXA1 and OPCML) individually distinguish lung adenocarcinoma from non-cancer lung with a sensitivity of 67-86% and specificity of 74-82%. DNA methylation of these loci did not differ significantly based on gender, race, age or tumor stage, indicating their wide applicability as potential lung adenocarcinoma markers. We applied random forests to determine a good classifier based on a subset of our loci and determined that combined use of the same four top markers allows identification of lung cancer tissue from non-lung cancer tissue with 94% sensitivity and 90% specificity. CONCLUSION: The identification of eight CpG island loci showing highly significant hypermethylation in lung adenocarcinoma provides strong candidates for evaluation in patient remote media such as plasma and sputum. The four most highly ranked loci, CDKN2A EX2, CDX2, HOXA1 and OPCML, which show significant DNA methylation even in stage IA tumor samples, merit further investigation as some of the most promising lung adenocarcinoma markers identified to date.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"17987801","pmcid":null,"title":"Up-regulation of Twist induces angiogenesis and correlates with metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma.","authors":["Niu RF","Zhang L","Xi GM","Wei XY","Yang Y","Shi YR","Hao XS"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR","journalShort":"J.

We previously showed that the I4 lines had dramatically elevated levels of Twist compared with their parental lines. In this study, we observed significantly increased STAT3 Tyr(705) phosphorylation, but not the STAT3 protein levels, in the I4 lines. Activation of STAT3 by interleukin-6 or expression of activated Src induced Twist expression at protein and mRNA levels. Inhibiting STAT3 by a small molecule inhibitor, JSI-124, STAT3 small hairpin RNAs, or dominant negative STAT3 resulted in significant reduction of Twist protein and mRNA expression. STAT3 directly bound to the second proximal STAT3-binding site on the human Twist promoter and activated its transcriptional activity. Inhibition of STAT3 reduced migration, invasion, and colony formation of the I4 cells. Ectopic expression of Twist significantly rescued those phenotypes. Ten normal and 46 tumor specimens of breast tissues were examined for activation of STAT3 and expression of Twist. There was a strong correlation between Tyr(705) p-STAT3 and Twist level in the late stage tumor tissues. Our results indicate that activated STAT3 transcriptionally induces Twist, which plays an important role in promoting migration, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth. Together with our previous observation that Twist transcriptionally induces AKT2 to mediate Twist-promoted oncogenic functions, we conclude that STAT3, Twist, and AKT2 form a functional signaling axis to regulate pivotal oncogenic properties of cancer cells.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"18062917","pmcid":null,"title":"Twist is a transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin gene expression in breast cancer.","authors":["Vesuna F","van Diest P","Chen JH","Raman V"],"grantIds":["R01 CA097226-01A2","R01CA097226"],"grantAgencies":["NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Biochemical and biophysical research communications","journalShort":"Biochem.

This indicates that although TWIST1 CpG methylation is useful as a biomarker in breast cancer diagnosis, there is no direct correlation with TWIST1 expression.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"20079104","pmcid":null,"title":"[Role of TWIST in the apoptosis of Hep-2 cells induced by paclitaxel].","authors":["Yu L","Li HZ","Lu SM","Liu WW","Tian JJ","Li JF","Wang HB","Xu W"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Zhonghua er bi yan hou tou jing wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of otorhinolaryngology head and neck surgery","journalShort":"Zhonghua Er Bi Yan Hou Tou Jing Wai Ke Za Zhi","day":18,"month":9,"year":2009,"meshHeadings":["Apoptosis","Cell Line, Tumor","Cell Proliferation","Flow Cytometry","Humans","Laryngeal Neoplasms","Nuclear Proteins","Paclitaxel","RNA, Messenger","Twist Transcription Factor"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between the expression of transcription factor TWIST and apoptosis of Hep-2 cells induced by paclitaxel. METHODS: Morphological changes of Hep-2 cells were observed by reserved microscopy and acridine orange cytochemistry staining. Viability of Hep-2 cells treated with various concentrations of paclitaxel was detected by MTT assay. Apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry. The expressions of transcription factor TWIST at both mRNA and protein level in response to paclitaxel at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h were then examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively. RESULTS: Typical morphological changes of apoptotic cells, i.e., cellular rounding-up, cytoplasmic contraction, chromatin condensation and, particularly, apoptotic body, the main morphological characteristic of apoptosis, were observed by reserved microscopy and acridine orange cytochemistry staining. The cell surviving rates significantly decreased in a concentration- and time-dependent manner as evidenced by MTT assay (P < 0.05). Percent of apoptosis after 24 h, 48 h or 72 h paclitaxel-treatment was (22.6 +/- 5.3)%, (38.7 +/- 7.9)% and (52.4 +/- 14.3)%, respectively, whereas the percent of control was (9.85 +/- 5.83)%. There existed a statistically significant difference between treatment and control (F = 12.621, P < 0.05). The expression of TWIST at both mRNA and protein levels for 24 h, 48 h or 72 h in the paclitaxel-induced apoptosis of Hep-2 cells were decreased by 16.7%, 46.8%, 76.9% (F = 10.407, P < 0.05) and 16.4%, 33.6%, 69.6% (F = 18.013, P < 0.05) respectively.

Therefore, we examined whether the presence of MSX2 correlates with the malignant behavior of pancreatic cancer cells. BxPC3 pancreatic cancer cells that stably overexpress MSX2 showed a flattened and scattered morphology accompanied by a change in localization of E-cadherin and beta-catenin from membrane to cytoplasm. Cell proliferation rate, cell migration, and anchorage-independent cell growth were enhanced in MSX2-expressing cells. Injection of MSX2-expressing cells into the pancreas of nude mice resulted in a significant increase in liver metastases and peritoneal disseminations compared with injection of control cells. Microarray analysis revealed a significant induction of Twist 1 expression in cells that express MSX2. When MSX2 was inactivated in pancreatic cancer cells following transfection with an MSX2-specific small interfering RNA, Twist 1 was down-regulated. Immunohistochemistry of human pancreatic carcinoma tissue revealed that MSX2 was frequently expressed in cancer cells, and that increased expression of MSX2 significantly correlated with higher tumor grade, vascular invasion, and Twist 1 expression. These data indicate that MSX2 plays a crucial role in pancreatic cancer development by inducing changes consistent with epithelial to mesenchymal transition through enhanced expression of Twist 1.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"19513566","pmcid":null,"title":"Negative regulation of TIMP1 is mediated by transcription factor TWIST1.","authors":["Okamura H","Yoshida K","Haneji T"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"International journal of oncology","journalShort":"Int.

Here, we determine how these variants influence breast cancer prognosis, risk and tumour characteristics. METHODS: We selected 1,001 women with early onset nonfamilial invasive breast cancer from the Prospective study of Outcomes in Sporadic versus Hereditary breast cancer (POSH) cohort and genotyped 206 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across 30 candidate genes. After quality control, 899 cases and 133 SNPs remained. Survival analyses were used to identify SNPs associated with prognosis and determine their interdependency with recognized prognostic factors. To identify SNPs that alter breast cancer risk, association tests were used to compare cases with controls from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. To search for SNPs affecting tumour biology, cases were stratified into subgroups according to oestrogen receptor (ER) status and grade and tested for association. RESULTS: We confirmed previous associations between increased breast cancer risk and SNPs in CASP8, TOX3 (previously known as TNRC9) and ESR1. Analysis of prognosis identified eight SNPs in six genes (MAP3K1, DAPK1, LSP1, MMP7, TOX3 and ESR1) and one region without genes on 8q24 that are associated with survival. For MMP7, TOX3 and MAP3K1 the effects on survival are independent of the main recognized clinical prognostic factors. The SNP in 8q24 is more weakly associated with independent effects on survival. Once grade and pathological nodal status (pN stage) were taken into account, SNPs in ESR1 and LSP1 showed no independent survival difference, whereas the effects of the DAPK1 SNP were removed when correcting for ER status. Interestingly, effects on survival for SNPs in ESR1 were most significant when only ER-positive tumours were examined. Stratifying POSH cases by tumour characteristics identified SNPs in FGFR2 and TOX3 associated with ER-positive disease and SNPs in ATM associated with ER-negative disease. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that several SNPs are associated with survival. In some cases this appears to be due to an effect on tumour characteristics known to have a bearing on prognosis; in other cases the effect appears to be independent of these prognostic factors. These findings require validation by further studies in similar patient groups.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"18480983","pmcid":null,"title":"Expression of Twist gene in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell strains of different metastatic potential.","authors":["Zhu Q","Xu H","Xu Q","Yan W","Tian D"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

METHODS: Snail, Twist, and E-cadherin expression were assessed by immunohistochemistry and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in 12 malignant and 35 benign pheochromocytomas (PCC). Data were correlated with clinical characteristics and genetics. RESULTS: We found Snail expression in 13 (28%) of 47 primary PCC samples. Twist was expressed in 31 (66%) of 47 cases. Only one of 47 PCC showed E-cadherin expression. We observed Snail expression in 7 (58%) of 12 malignant PCC, whereas only 6 (17%) of 35 apparently benign PCC revealed Snail expression (P = 0.01). Furthermore, 11 (92%) of 12 malignant PCC, but only 20 (57%) of 35 benign PCC, revealed Twist expression (P = 0.03). Interestingly, all five metastases showed Snail and Twist expression.

In vivo, transgenic mice expressing twist-1 in the adipose tissue are prone to high-fat-diet-induced obesity, whereas twist-1 heterozygous knockout mice are obesity resistant.

However, few authors have examined the expression of Twist and E-cadherin and their prognostic value in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical significance of Twist and E-cadherin expression in ESCC. METHODS: We immunohistochemically investigated the relationship between their expression and clinicopathological factors including prognosis in surgical specimens of primary tumors in 166 patients with ESCC. RESULTS: The expression rate of high Twist was 42.0% and that of preserved E-cadherin was 40.4%. The expression of high Twist and reduced E-cadherin was significantly associated with depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, distant nodal metastasis, stage and lymphatic invasion, and poor prognosis. High Twist expression significantly correlated with reduced E-cadherin expression. In the preserved E-cadherin group, the 5-year survival rate was better for patients who were low for Twist expression than for those who were high for Twist expression. Multivariate analysis indicated that the combination of low Twist and preserved E-cadherin expression was an independent prognostic factor along with tumor depth, distant nodal metastasis and E-cadherin expression. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of Twist and E-cadherin expressions should be useful for determining tumor properties, including prognosis, in patients with ESCC.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"19470737","pmcid":null,"title":"Hypermethylated genes as biomarkers of cancer in women with pathologic nipple discharge.","authors":["Fackler MJ","Rivers A","Teo WW","Mangat A","Taylor E","Zhang Z","Goodman S","Argani P","Nayar R","Susnik B","Sukumar S","Khan SA"],"grantIds":["CA88843-AV-14P1","P50 CA088843","P50 CA88843"],"grantAgencies":["NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research","journalShort":"Clin.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Women with PND underwent ductoscopy; ducts with significant lesions were surgically resected (36 ducts in 33 women) and those with minimal findings were not (28 ducts in 16 women). QM-MSP was done on ductoscopy cell samples. Results were compared with cytology and tissue histology. RESULTS: Cells from ducts with significant lesions on ductoscopy had significantly higher levels of methylation than those with minimal findings. Furthermore, cells from ducts with DCIS displayed higher levels of methylation than those with benign lesions such as papilloma (P = 0.006); or ducts with minimal findings on ductoscopy (P = 0.0001). Cumulative RASSF1A, TWIST1, and HIN1 gene methylation accurately distinguished ducts with cancerous versus benign lesions (100% sensitivity, 72% specificity, and area under the curve of 0.91 according to receiving operating characteristic analyses). QM-MSP analysis was more informative than cytology (100% versus 29% sensitivity, respectively), for detecting DCIS. In a validation set of paraffin-embedded DCIS and papilloma samples from women presenting with PND, QM-MSP was significantly higher in DNA from DCIS than papilloma sections (P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: The positive predictive value of ductoscopy was more than doubled (19% versus 47%) with the addition of QM-MSP, demonstrating the benefit of targeting ducts having both high methylation and significant abnormalities on ductoscopy for surgical excision. Future large-scale studies to validate this approach are needed.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"19851501","pmcid":"2761603","title":"Twist: a regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition in lung fibrosis.","authors":["Pozharskaya V","Torres-González E","Rojas M","Gal A","Amin M","Dollard S","Roman J","Stecenko AA","Mora AL"],"grantIds":["R21 HL 080284-01","UL1 TR000454"],"grantAgencies":["NHLBI NIH HHS","NCATS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"PloS one","journalShort":"PLoS ONE","day":23,"month":10,"year":2009,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Cadherins","Epithelial Cells","Epithelium","Fibrosis","Gene Expression Regulation","Herpesviridae","Herpesviridae Infections","Humans","Lung","Mesoderm","Mice","Nuclear Proteins","Pulmonary Alveoli","Pulmonary Fibrosis","Twist Transcription Factor"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"BACKGROUND: Several studies have implicated viral infection as an important factor in the pathogenesis of IPF and related fibrotic lung disorders. Viruses are thought to cause epithelial cell injury and promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process whereby differentiated epithelial cells undergo transition to a mesenchymal phenotype, and considered a source of fibroblasts in the setting of lung injury. We have demonstrated an association between the epithelial injury caused by chronic herpes virus infection with the murine gamma-herpes virus, MHV68, and lung fibrosis. We hypothesize that EMT in this model of virus-induced pulmonary fibrosis is driven by the expression of the transcription factor Twist. METHODS/FINDINGS: In vitro MHV68 infection of murine lung epithelial cells induced expression of Twist, and mesenchymal markers. Stable overexpression of Twist promoted EMT in MLE15 lung epithelial cells. Transient knockdown expression of Twist resulted in preservation of epithelial phenotype after in vitro MHV68 infection. In concordance, high expression of Twist was found in lung epithelial cells of MHV68 infected mice, but not in mock infected mice. Alveolar epithelial cells from lung tissue of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients were strongly positive for Twist. These cells demonstrated features of EMT with low expression of E-cadherin and upregulation of the mesenchymal marker N-cadherin. Finally, IPF tissue with high Twist protein levels was also positive for the herpesvirus, EBV. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that Twist contributes to EMT in the model of virus-induced pulmonary fibrosis. We speculate that in some IPF cases, gamma-herpes virus infection with EBV might be a source of injury precipitating EMT through the expression of Twist.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"19863427","pmcid":null,"title":"Germline mutation screening of the Saethre-Chotzen-associated genes TWIST1 and FGFR3 in families with BRCA1/2-negative breast cancer.","authors":["Bergman A","Sahlin P","Emanuelsson M","Carén H","Tarnow P","Martinsson T","Grönberg H","Stenman G"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Scandinavian journal of plastic and reconstructive surgery and hand surgery / Nordisk plastikkirurgisk forening [and] Nordisk klubb for handkirurgi","journalShort":"Scand J Plast Reconstr Surg Hand Surg","day":29,"month":10,"year":2009,"meshHeadings":["Acrocephalosyndactylia","Adult","Breast Neoplasms","Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit","DNA-Binding Proteins","Ephrin-B1","Female","Genes, BRCA1","Genes, BRCA2","Genetic Testing","Germ-Line Mutation","Homeodomain Proteins","Humans","Middle Aged","Nuclear Proteins","Polymerase Chain Reaction","Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1","Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2","Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3","Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 4","Sequence Analysis, DNA","Transcription Factors","Twist Transcription Factor"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is one of the most common craniosynostosis syndromes.

The present study aimed at investigating clinical Twist expression in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in order to correlate the Twist levels with the patients' survival rates and their other clinical parameters. Immunohistochemical staining using polyclonal Twist antibody was performed on paraffin embedded specimens of 112 ESCC patients and non-neoplastic esophageal epithelium used as a control. The overall staining intensity was analyzed along with clinicopathologic data and prognosis of ESCC. Twist expression was significantly higher in ESCC than in non-neoplastic oesophageal epithelium (P < 0.001). The Twist expression directly correlated with distant metastasis after esophagectomy (P = 0.001). Kaplan-Meier estimate in conjunction with the log-rank test revealed an inverse proportion relationship between postoperative survival rates of the patients and their Twist expression levels (log-rank, P < 0.001). In addition, Cox mono-variate analysis revealed that T/N classification, pTNM stage, distant metastasis and Twist expression were significantly correlated with mortality risk of patients after operation (P < 0.05). By Cox multi-variate analysis, Twist expression (risk ratio = 2.394; P < 0.001) and N classification were identified as the independent prognostic factors of patient survival. In conclusion, upregulated Twist expression in the primary ESCC significantly correlates with the high risk of subsequent development of distant metastasis and low postoperative survival rates; the latter was not significantly correlated with patients' age, gender, tumor location and differentiation. Twist may serve as an independent prognostic marker for predicting development of distant metastasis in ESCC patients and their survival.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"20019840","pmcid":null,"title":"Twist modulates breast cancer stem cells by transcriptional regulation of CD24 expression.","authors":["Vesuna F","Lisok A","Kimble B","Raman V"],"grantIds":["P50 CA103175","R01CA097226"],"grantAgencies":["NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)","journalShort":"Neoplasia","day":18,"month":12,"year":2009,"meshHeadings":["Aldehyde Dehydrogenase","Animals","Antigens, CD24","Antigens, CD44","Binding Sites","Breast Neoplasms","Cell Line","Cell Line, Tumor","Female","Flow Cytometry","Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic","Humans","Immunoblotting","Isoenzymes","Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental","Mice","Mice, SCID","Neoplastic Stem Cells","Nuclear Proteins","Promoter Regions, Genetic","Protein Binding","RNA Interference","Retinal Dehydrogenase","Transcription, Genetic","Transplantation, Heterologous","Twist Transcription Factor"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"The cancer stem cell paradigm postulates that dysregulated tissue-specific stem cells or progenitor cells are precursors for cancer biogenesis. Consequently, identifying cancer stem cells is crucial to our understanding of cancer progression and for the development of novel therapeutic agents.

In addition, Twist-overexpressing cells exhibit high efflux of Hoechst 33342 and Rhodamine 123 as a result of increased expression of ABCC1 (MRP1) transporters, a property of cancer stem cells. Moreover, we show that transient expression of Twist can induce the stem cell phenotype in multiple breast cell lines and that decreasing Twist expression by short hairpin RNA in Twist-overexpressing transgenic cell lines MCF-10A/Twist and MCF-7/Twist as well as in MDA-MB-231 partially reverses the stem cell molecular signature.

INTRODUCTION: TWIST1, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, has been implicated in cell lineage determination and differentiation. METHODS: To address the genetic variations in the TWIST1 gene associated with osteoporosis, we investigated the potential involvement of three TWIST1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in osteoporosis in 729 postmenopausal women. BMD was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: A novel polymorphism in the 3' flanking region (+1871A>G) was significantly associated with osteoporosis risk (p = 0.007-0.008) and also in multiple comparison (p = 0.02). Consistent with these results, haplotype analysis showed that Block1_ht2 had protective effects in the dominant and additive model (p = 0.006-0.007). Specifically, the +1871A>G polymorphism was overdominantly associated with higher BMD values of the femoral neck (p = 0.039).

Reduced E-cadherin and nonmembranous beta-catenin expression, the hallmarks of EMT, were shown in 60.2% and 51.5% of primary HCC samples, respectively. Overexpression of Snail, Twist, or Slug, the major regulators of EMT, was identified in 56.9%, 43.1%, and 51.4% of primary HCCs, respectively. Statistical analysis determined that Snail and Twist, but not Slug, are major EMT inducers in HCC: overexpression of Snail and/or Twist correlated with down-regulation of E-cadherin, nonmembranous expression of beta-catenin, and a worse prognosis. In contrast, there were no such significant differences in samples that overexpressed Slug. Coexpression of Snail and Twist correlated with the worst prognosis of HCC. Hepatitis C-associated HCC was significantly correlated with Twist overexpression.

Twist1 expression was measured before and after weight loss as well as in different adipose regions. Human in vitro differentiated adipocytes were treated with TNFα under control conditions or after twist1 gene silencing by RNA interference. Gene expression and secretion of proinflammatory proteins were measured. RESULTS: Twist1 expression was low in obese subjects and increased after weight loss. Twist1 mRNA levels correlated with adiponectin levels and inversely with insulin resistance as well as adipocyte volume (P < 0.001 for all). Low twist1 expression associated with a hypertrophic adipose tissue and high secretion of TNFα and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 from WAT. Finally, twist1 silencing in human adipocytes enhanced TNFα-induced monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 expression and secretion, which was paralleled by an increase in the mRNA expression of the nuclear factor-κB gene RelA. CONCLUSIONS: Low twist1 expression in human WAT correlates with obesity and an insulin-resistant phenotype, which may be mediated by an increased sensitivity to the proinflammatory effect of TNFα.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"21559426","pmcid":"3084786","title":"Phosphorylation of the Twist1-family basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors is involved in pathological cardiac remodeling.","authors":["Lu S","Nie J","Luan Q","Feng Q","Xiao Q","Chang Z","Shan C","Hess D","Hemmings BA","Yang Z"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"PloS one","journalShort":"PLoS ONE","day":11,"month":5,"year":2011,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors","Echocardiography","Humans","Mice","Mice, Transgenic","Mutation","Myocardium","Nuclear Proteins","Phosphorylation","Plasmids","Recombinant Fusion Proteins","Transcription Factors","Twist Transcription Factor","Ventricular Remodeling"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"BACKGROUND: The Twist1-family basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors including Twist1, Hand1 and Hand2, play an essential role in heart development and are implicated in pathological heart remodeling. Previously, it was reported that these bHLH transcription factors can be regulated by phosphorylation within the basic-helix I domain, which is involved in developmental processes such as limb formation and trophoblast differentiation. However, how phosphorylation of Twist1 family functions in post-natal heart is elusive. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we generated transgenic mice with over-expression of Hand1 and Twist1 mutants (to mimic or to abolish phosphorylation) in cardiomyocytes and found pathological cardiac remodeling leading to heart failure and sudden death. Gene expression profile analysis revealed up-regulation of growth-promoting genes and down-regulation of metabolic genes. It is well known that aberrant activation of Akt signaling causes pathological cardiac remodeling and results in heart failure. The basic-helix I domain of Twist1 family members contain Akt substrate consensus motif and may be downstream targets of Akt signaling. Using biochemical analysis, we demonstrated that Hand1 and Twist1 were phosphorylated by Akt in the basic-helix I domain. Phosphorylation of Hand1 regulated its transcriptional activation of luciferase reporter genes and DNA binding ability. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel insights into the regulation of Twist1 family in cardiac remodeling and suggests that the Twist1 family can be regulated by Akt signaling.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"20400976","pmcid":null,"title":"PKB/AKT phosphorylation of the transcription factor Twist-1 at Ser42 inhibits p53 activity in response to DNA damage.","authors":["Vichalkovski A","Gresko E","Hess D","Restuccia DF","Hemmings BA"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Oncogene","journalShort":"Oncogene","day":17,"month":6,"year":2010,"meshHeadings":["Amino Acid Sequence","Apoptosis","Cell Cycle","Cell Line, Tumor","Cell Nucleus","DNA Damage","Down-Regulation","Doxorubicin","Enzyme Activation","Gamma Rays","Humans","Molecular Sequence Data","Neoplasms","Nuclear Proteins","Phosphorylation","Protein Processing, Post-Translational","Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt","Serine","Transcriptional Activation","Tumor Suppressor Protein p53","Twist Transcription Factor"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) is ubiquitously expressed in cells. Phosphorylation of its multiple targets in response to various stimuli, including growth factors or cytokines, promotes cell survival and inhibits apoptosis. PKB is upregulated in many different cancers and a significant amount of the enzyme is present in its activated form. Here we show that PKB phosphorylates one of the anti-apoptotic proteins--transcription factor Twist-1 at Ser42. Cells expressing Twist-1 displayed inefficient p53 upregulation in response to DNA damage induced by gamma-irradiation or the genotoxic drug adriamycin. This influenced the activation of p53 target genes such as p21(Waf1) and Bax and led to aberrant cell-cycle regulation and the inhibition of apoptosis. The impaired induction of these p53 effector molecules is likely to be mediated by PKB-dependent phosphorylation of Twist-1 because, unlike the wild-type mutant, the Twist-1 S42A mutant did not confer cell resistance to DNA damage. Moreover, phosphorylation of Twist-1 at Ser42 was shown in vivo in various human cancer tissues, suggesting that this post-translational modification ensures functional activation of Twist-1 after promotion of survival during carcinogenesis.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"19893041","pmcid":null,"title":"Gene expression profiling of pulmonary fibrosis identifies Twist1 as an antiapoptotic molecular \"rectifier\" of growth factor signaling.","authors":["Bridges RS","Kass D","Loh K","Glackin C","Borczuk AC","Greenberg S"],"grantIds":["1K08HL083085","2P30ES009089"],"grantAgencies":["NHLBI NIH HHS","NIEHS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"The American journal of pathology","journalShort":"Am.

To gain insight into IPF pathogenesis, we performed gene expression profiling of IPF lungs. Twist1, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, was found among the most consistently and highly up-regulated genes and was expressed in nuclei of type II epithelial cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts in IPF lungs. We studied the function of Twist1 in fibroblasts further, because they are the major effector cells in this disease and persist despite an ambient proapoptotic environment. Twist1 was induced by the profibrotic growth factors (GFs) basic fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and epidermal growth factor in primary rat lung fibroblasts (RLFs). Suppression of Twist1 expression resulted in decreased RLF accumulation due to increased apoptosis, whereas Twist1 overexpression protected RLFs against several apoptotic stimuli. Addition of platelet-derived growth factor in combination with other GFs led to an increase in proliferation. When Twist1 was depleted, GFs continued to act as mitogens but caused a marked increase in cell death. The increase in apoptosis under basal or growth factor-stimulated conditions was partly mediated by up-regulation of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, Bim and PUMA. These findings indicate that Twist1 promotes survival and accumulation of fibroblasts by shaping their responsiveness to growth factor stimulation. We propose that Twist1 represents one of the factors that promotes pathogenic accumulation of fibroblasts in fibrotic lung disease.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"20007935","pmcid":"2828644","title":"A possible inflammatory role of twist1 in human white adipocytes.","authors":["Pettersson AT","Laurencikiene J","Mejhert N","Näslund E","Bouloumié A","Dahlman I","Arner P","Rydén M"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Diabetes","journalShort":"Diabetes","day":1,"month":3,"year":2010,"meshHeadings":["3T3-L1 Cells","Adipocytes, White","Adiponectin","Adult","Animals","Carbon Radioisotopes","Chemokine CCL2","Down-Regulation","Female","Gene Expression","Genes, Reporter","Humans","Interleukin-6","Lipolysis","Male","Mice","Middle Aged","Nuclear Proteins","Oxidation-Reduction","Palmitates","Promoter Regions, Genetic","RNA, Small Interfering","Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha","Twist Transcription Factor"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Twist1 is a transcription factor that is highly expressed in murine brown and white adipose tissue (WAT) and negatively regulates fatty acid oxidation in mice. The role of twist1 in WAT is not known and was therefore examined. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The expression of twist1 was determined by quantitative real-time PCR in different tissues and in different cell types within adipose tissue. The effect of twist1 small interfering RNA on fatty acid oxidation, lipolysis, adipokine secretion, and mRNA expression was determined in human adipocytes. The interaction between twist1 and specific promoters in human adipocytes was investigated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and reporter assays. RESULTS: Twist1 was highly expressed in human WAT compared with a set of other tissues and found predominantly in adipocytes. Twist1 levels increased during in vitro differentiation of human preadipocytes. Gene silencing of twist1 in human white adipocytes had no effect on lipolysis or glucose transport. Unexpectedly, and in contrast with results in mice, twist1 RNA interference reduced fatty acid oxidation. Furthermore, the expression and secretion of the inflammatory factors tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were downregulated by twist1 silencing. ChIP and reporter assays confirmed twist1 interaction with the promoters of these genes. CONCLUSIONS: Twist1 may play a role in inflammation of human WAT because it can regulate the expression and secretion of inflammatory adipokines via direct transcriptional effects in white adipocytes. Furthermore, twist1 may, in contrast to findings in mice, be a positive regulator of fatty acid oxidation in human white adipocytes.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"20643727","pmcid":null,"title":"Prevalence and complications of single-gene and chromosomal disorders in craniosynostosis.","authors":["Wilkie AO","Byren JC","Hurst JA","Jayamohan J","Johnson D","Knight SJ","Lester T","Richards PG","Twigg SR","Wall SA"],"grantIds":["075491","078666","078666"],"grantAgencies":["Wellcome Trust","Wellcome Trust","Wellcome Trust"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Pediatrics","journalShort":"Pediatrics","day":3,"month":8,"year":2010,"meshHeadings":["Chromosome Aberrations","Craniosynostoses","Cytogenetic Analysis","Exons","Genetic Diseases, Inborn","Humans","Infant","Infant, Newborn","Molecular Biology","Neurosurgical Procedures","Point Mutation","Prevalence","Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3","Reconstructive Surgical Procedures","Signal Transduction"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"OBJECTIVES: We describe the first cohort-based analysis of the impact of genetic disorders in craniosynostosis. We aimed to refine the understanding of prognoses and pathogenesis and to provide rational criteria for clinical genetic testing. METHODS: We undertook targeted molecular genetic and cytogenetic testing for 326 children who required surgery because of craniosynostosis, were born in 1993-2002, presented to a single craniofacial unit, and were monitored until the end of 2007. RESULTS: Eighty-four children (and 64 relatives) had pathologic genetic alterations (86% single-gene mutations and 14% chromosomal abnormalities). The FGFR3 P250R mutation was the single largest contributor (24%) to the genetic group. Genetic diagnoses accounted for 21% of all craniosynostosis cases and were associated with increased rates of many complications. Children with an initial clinical diagnosis of nonsyndromic craniosynostosis were more likely to have a causative mutation if the synostoses were unicoronal or bicoronal (10 of 48 cases) than if they were sagittal or metopic (0 of 55 cases; P = .0003). Repeat craniofacial surgery was required for 58% of children with single-gene mutations but only 17% of those with chromosomal abnormalities (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical genetic assessment is critical for the treatment of children with craniosynostosis. Genetic testing of nonsyndromic cases (at least for FGFR3 P250R and FGFR2 exons IIIa/c) should be targeted to patients with coronal or multisuture synostoses. Single-gene disorders that disrupt physiologic signaling in the cranial sutures often require reoperation, whereas chromosomal abnormalities follow a more-indolent course, which suggests a different, secondary origin of the associated craniosynostosis.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"19954024","pmcid":null,"title":"[Down-regulation of Twist1 increases the sensitivity of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines HNE1 to taxol].","authors":["Meng DW","Bao JM","Ma YP","Li Z","Li SJ","Li D"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Zhonghua er bi yan hou tou jing wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of otorhinolaryngology head and neck surgery","journalShort":"Zhonghua Er Bi Yan Hou Tou Jing Wai Ke Za Zhi","day":3,"month":6,"year":2009,"meshHeadings":["Apoptosis","Cell Line, Tumor","Down-Regulation","Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic","Humans","Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms","Nuclear Proteins","Paclitaxel","RNA Interference","RNA, Small Interfering","Twist Transcription Factor"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether down-regulation of Twist1 could change sensitivity of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line HNE1 to taxol.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Genotypes for 1536 SNPs in 357 cleft candidate genes were available from a previous analysis in which we focused on fetal gene effects. After data-cleaning, genotypes for 1315 SNPs in 334 autosomal genes were available for the current analysis of maternal gene effects. Two complementary statistical methods, TRIMM and HAPLIN, were used to detect multi-marker effects in population-based samples from Norway (562 case-parent and 592 control-parent triads) and Denmark (235 case-parent triads). We analyzed isolated cleft lip with or without cleft palate (iCL/P) and isolated cleft palate only (iCP) separately and assessed replication by looking for genes detected in both populations by both methods. In iCL/P, neither TRIMM nor HAPLIN detected more genes than expected by chance alone; furthermore, the selected genes were not replicated across the two methods. In iCP, however, FLNB was identified by both methods in both populations. Although HIC1 and ZNF189 did not fully satisfy our stringency criterion for replication, they were strongly associated with iCP in TRIMM analyses of the Norwegian triads. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Except for FLNB, HIC1 and ZNF189, maternal genes did not appear to influence the risk of clefting in our data. This is consistent with recent epidemiological findings showing no apparent difference between mother-to-offspring and father-to-offspring recurrence of clefts in these two populations.

We hypothesized that thrombin, an activator of protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1 and PAR-4 contributes to tumor metastasis. In this study, we demonstrated that thrombin and the PAR-1 activating peptide (AP) SFLLRN, but not the PAR-4 AP GYPGKF, induced HIF-1α activities, protein expression, and cell motility in colorectal cancer cells, and these actions were significantly inhibited by the PAR-1 antagonist SCH79797. Moreover, thrombin-induced HIF-1α activity and cell motility were blocked by inhibiting important mediators of signaling transduction, including the ERK, PI3K, and mTOR pathways. These results showed that thrombin induced HIF-1α protein expression through PAR-1 and HIF-1α translational de novo protein synthesis. Twist can regulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increase tumor metastasis. However, we observed that thrombin-induced HIF-1α increased Twist mRNA and its protein level was mediated by the modulation of PAR-1 activation and the HIF-1α translational pathway. In addition, Twist could increase N-cadherin but not E-cadherin to promote tumor metastasis. Overexpression of dominant-negative HIF-1α reversed thrombin-mediated Twist and Twist-induced N-cadherin expression.

However, one of the key problems in the use of MSCs for these applications is the efficiency of these cells to engraft and fully regenerate damaged tissues. Therefore, to optimize this process, a comprehensive understanding of the key regulators of MSCs self-renewal and maintenance are critical to the success of future cell therapy as well as other clinical applications.

Therefore, better understandings of mechanisms that promote mesenchymal change in GBM are of great clinical importance to address invasion. We previously showed that the bHLH transcription factor TWIST1 which orchestrates carcinoma metastasis through an epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is upregulated in GBM and promotes invasion of the SF767 GBM cell line in vitro. RESULTS: To further define TWIST1 functions in GBM we tested the impact of TWIST1 over-expression on invasion in vivo and its impact on gene expression. We found that TWIST1 significantly increased SNB19 and T98G cell line invasion in orthotopic xenotransplants and increased expression of genes in functional categories associated with adhesion, extracellular matrix proteins, cell motility and locomotion, cell migration and actin cytoskeleton organization. Consistent with this TWIST1 reduced cell aggregation, promoted actin cytoskeletal re-organization and enhanced migration and adhesion to fibronectin substrates. Individual genes upregulated by TWIST1 known to promote EMT and/or GBM invasion included SNAI2, MMP2, HGF, FAP and FN1. Distinct from carcinoma EMT, TWIST1 did not generate an E- to N-cadherin \"switch\" in GBM cell lines. The clinical relevance of putative TWIST target genes SNAI2 and fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP) identified in vitro was confirmed by their highly correlated expression with TWIST1 in 39 human tumors. The potential therapeutic importance of inhibiting TWIST1 was also shown through a decrease in cell invasion in vitro and growth of GBM stem cells. CONCLUSIONS: Together these studies demonstrated that TWIST1 enhances GBM invasion in concert with mesenchymal change not involving the canonical cadherin switch of carcinoma EMT. Given the recent recognition that mesenchymal change in GBMs is associated with increased malignancy, these findings support the potential therapeutic importance of strategies to subvert TWIST1-mediated mesenchymal change.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"20838384","pmcid":"3007675","title":"Suppression of Her2/neu expression through ILK inhibition is regulated by a pathway involving TWIST and YB-1.","authors":["Kalra J","Sutherland BW","Stratford AL","Dragowska W","Gelmon KA","Dedhar S","Dunn SE","Bally MB"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Oncogene","journalShort":"Oncogene","day":2,"month":12,"year":2010,"meshHeadings":["Azo Compounds","DNA-Binding Proteins","Humans","Nuclear Proteins","Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases","Pyrazoles","RNA, Small Interfering","Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor","Receptor, ErbB-2","STAT3 Transcription Factor","Signal Transduction","Tumor Cells, Cultured","Twist Transcription Factor","Y-Box-Binding Protein 1"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"In a previous study it was found that the therapeutic effects of QLT0267, a small molecule inhibitor of integrin-linked kinase (ILK), were influenced by Her2/neu expression. To understand how inhibition or silencing of ILK influences Her2/neu expression, Her2/neu signaling was evaluated in six Her2/neu-positive breast cancer cell lines (LCC6(Her2), MCF7(Her2), SKBR3, BT474, JIMT-1 and KPL-4). Treatment with QLT0267 engendered suppression (32-87%) of total Her2/neu protein in these cells. Suppression of Her2/neu was also observed following small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of ILK expression. Time course studies suggest that ILK inhibition or silencing caused transient decreases in P-AKT(ser473), which were not temporally related to Her2/neu downregulation. Attenuation of ILK activity or expression was, however, associated with decreases in YB-1 (Y-box binding protein-1) protein and transcript levels. YB-1 is a known transcriptional regulator of Her2/neu expression, and in this study it is demonstrated that inhibition of ILK activity using QLT0267 decreased YB-1 promoter activity by 50.6%. ILK inhibition was associated with changes in YB-1 localization, as reflected by localization of cytoplasmic YB-1 into stress granules. ILK inhibition also suppressed TWIST (a regulator of YB-1 expression) protein expression. To confirm the role of ILK on YB-1 and TWIST, cells were engineered to overexpress ILK. This was associated with a fourfold increase in the level of YB-1 in the nucleus, and a 2- and 1.5-fold increase in TWIST and Her2/neu protein levels, respectively. Taken together, these data indicate that ILK regulates the expression of Her2/neu through TWIST and YB-1, lending support to the use of ILK inhibitors in the treatment of aggressive Her2/neu-positive tumors.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"21866569","pmcid":null,"title":"The basic helix loop helix transcription factor Twist1 is a novel regulator of ATF4 in osteoblasts.","authors":["Danciu TE","Li Y","Koh A","Xiao G","McCauley LK","Franceschi RT"],"grantIds":["DE11723","DE13386","DK 53904","DK072230","K22 DE016614-05","K22DE016614","R01 AR059647","R01 DE011723","R01 DE011723-14","R01 DE013386","R01 DE013386-10","R01 DK053904","R01 DK053904-13","R01 DK072230","R01 DK072230-05"],"grantAgencies":["NIDCR NIH HHS","NIDCR NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDCR NIH HHS","NIDCR NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIDCR NIH HHS","NIDCR NIH HHS","NIDCR NIH HHS","NIDCR NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Journal of cellular biochemistry","journalShort":"J.

In this study, we discovered a novel function of PTH: its ability to dramatically decrease Twist1 transcription.

We mapped the interaction domain of Twist proteins to the C-terminal \"box\" domain and of ATF4, to the N-terminus.

Unfortunately, the survival of patients with SCCHN has not improved in the last 40 years, and thus new targets for therapy are needed. Recently, elevations in serum level of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and expression of Twist in tumor samples were found to be associated with poor clinical outcomes in multiple types of cancer, including SCCHN. Although Twist has been proposed as a master regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis in cancers, the mechanisms by which Twist levels are regulated post-translationally are not completely understood. Tumor progression is characterized by the involvement of cytokines and growth factors and Twist induction has been connected with a number of these signaling pathways including IL-6. Since many of the effects of IL-6 are mediated through activation of protein phosphorylation cascades, this implies that Twist expression must be under a tight control at the post-translational level in order to respond in a timely manner to external stimuli. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Our data show that IL-6 increases Twist expression via a transcription-independent mechanism in many SCCHN cell lines. Further investigation revealed that IL-6 stabilizes Twist in SCCHN cell lines through casein kinase 2 (CK2) phosphorylation of Twist residues S18 and S20, and that this phosphorylation inhibits degradation of Twist. Twist phosphorylation not only increases its stability but also enhances cell motility. Thus, post-translational modulation of Twist contributes to its tumor-promoting properties. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study shows Twist expression can be regulated at the post-translational level through phosphorylation by CK2, which increases Twist stability in response to IL-6 stimulation. Our findings not only provide novel mechanistic insights into post-translational regulation of Twist but also suggest that CK2 may be a viable therapeutic target in SCCHN.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"20804746","pmcid":null,"title":"Twist1 promotes heart valve cell proliferation and extracellular matrix gene expression during development in vivo and is expressed in human diseased aortic valves.","authors":["Chakraborty S","Wirrig EE","Hinton RB","Merrill WH","Spicer DB","Yutzey KE"],"grantIds":["HL082716","HL085122","HL094319","R01 HL082716","R01 HL094319"],"grantAgencies":["NHLBI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Developmental biology","journalShort":"Dev.

The requirements for Twist1 down-regulation in the remodeling valves and the consequences of prolonged Twist1 activity were examined in transgenic mice with persistent expression of Twist1 in developing and mature valves. Persistent Twist1 expression in the remodeling valves leads to increased valve cell proliferation, increased expression of Tbx20, and increased extracellular matrix (ECM) gene expression, characteristic of early valve progenitors. Among the ECM genes predominant in the EC, Col2a1 was identified as a direct transcriptional target of Twist1. Increased Twist1 expression also leads to dysregulation of fibrillar collagen and periostin expression, as well as enlarged hypercellular valve leaflets prior to birth. In human diseased aortic valves, increased Twist1 expression and cell proliferation are observed adjacent to nodules of calcification.

We investigated gene and protein expression patterns of the E-cadherin repressors SNAIL, ZEB1, and TWIST in relation to clinicopathologic parameters, in a series of 88 patients with invasive breast ductal carcinomas. Up-regulation of SNAIL messenger RNA (P = .008) and down-regulation of TWIST (P = .022) were associated with triple-negative tumors, whereas ZEB1 gene expression was more frequent in hormone-positive tumors (P = .004). Loss of E-cadherin was found in 19% of the tumors, but it did not correlate with aberrant expression of any of the repressors investigated herein. Nonetheless, we found that ZEB-1 protein overexpression inversely correlated with high tumor grade (P = .018), nuclear grade (P = .002), and presence of lymph nodes (P = .001), and these data were consistent with the gene expression data for ZEB1. Clinically, down-regulation of ZEB1 messenger RNA was associated with poor overall survival (P = .011) and disease-free survival (P = .053), whereas patients with TWIST negative tumors had a worse overall survival (P = .008) and disease-free survival (P = .006). Our data indicate that deregulation of TWIST is somehow important in the aggressiveness of triple-negative carcinomas and poor patient outcome, whereas down-regulation of ZEB1 seems to play a role in tumor spread, metastases, and poor survival.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"21317430","pmcid":null,"title":"Functional cooperation between Snail1 and twist in the regulation of ZEB1 expression during epithelial to mesenchymal transition.","authors":["Dave N","Guaita-Esteruelas S","Gutarra S","Frias À","Beltran M","Peiró S","de Herreros AG"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"The Journal of biological chemistry","journalShort":"J.

In this article we have analyzed the factors controlling Zeb1 expression during EMT. In NMuMG cells treated with TGF-β, Snail1 RNA and protein are induced 1 h after addition of the cytokine preceding Zeb1 up-regulation that requires 6-8 h. Zeb1 gene expression is caused by increased RNA levels but also by enhanced protein stability and is markedly dependent on Snail1 because depletion of this protein prevents Zeb1 protein and RNA up-regulation. In addition to Snail1, depletion of the Twist transcriptional factor retards Zeb1 stimulation by TGF-β or decreases Zeb1 expression in other cellular models indicating that this factor is also required for Zeb1 expression. Accordingly, Snail1 and Twist cooperate in the induction of Zeb1: co-transfection of both cDNAs is required for the maximal expression of ZEB1 mRNA. Unexpectedly, the expression of Snail1 and Twist shows a mutual dependence although to a different extent; whereas Twist depletion retards Snail1 up-regulation by TGF-β, Snail1 is necessary for the rapid increase in Twist protein and later up-regulation of Twist1 mRNA induced by the cytokine. Besides this effect on Twist, Snail1 also induces the nuclear translocation of Ets1, another factor required for Zeb1 expression. Both Twist and Ets1 bind to the ZEB1 promoter although to different elements: whereas Ets1 interacts with the proximal promoter, Twist does it with a 700-bp sequence upstream of the transcription start site. These results indicate that Snail1 controls Zeb1 expression at multiple levels and acts cooperatively with Twist in the ZEB1 gene transcription induction.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"21333765","pmcid":null,"title":"Microdeletions of chromosome 7p21, including TWIST1, associated with significant microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, and short stature.","authors":["Busche A","Graul-Neumann LM","Zweier C","Rauch A","Klopocki E","Horn D"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"European journal of medical genetics","journalShort":"Eur J Med Genet","day":3,"month":5,"year":2011,"meshHeadings":["Abnormalities, Multiple","Adolescent","Child, Preschool","Chromosome Deletion","Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7","Comparative Genomic Hybridization","Face","Female","Growth Disorders","Humans","In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence","Infant","Karyotyping","Male","Microcephaly","Nuclear Proteins","Syndrome","Twist Transcription Factor"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Saethre-Chotzen syndrome due to TWIST1 mutations is characterized by coronal synostosis, facial dysmorphism and additional variable anomalies.

Foxo3a is a member of the Foxo transcription factor family that modulates the expression of various genes. We aimed to elucidate the role of Foxo3a in UC invasion. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Foxo3a mRNA and protein expressions in UC samples were investigated by gene expression assays and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Foxo3a expression was compared with clinicopathologic characteristics and patient prognoses based on UC samples. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and migration assays were also conducted in UC cells. RESULTS: Foxo3a expression decreased in invasive UC; patients with low Foxo3a expression had poor disease-free survival, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival; Foxo3a knockdown in UC cells increased cellular motility. Foxo3a negatively regulated Twist1 and Y-box-binding protein 1 (YB-1), and positively regulated E-cadherin in KK47 and TCCsup cells that expressed Twist1, but not in T24 cells that did not express Twist1. Foxo3a-associated acetyltransferase p300 and Foxo3a acetylation status also affected UC motility. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that Foxo3a regulates motility of UC through negative regulation of Twist1 and YB-1, and through positive regulation of E-cadherin. This suggests that Foxo3a could act as an independent prognostic factor in UC and could represent a promising molecular target for cancer therapeutics.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"21397860","pmcid":null,"title":"Twist1-induced invadopodia formation promotes tumor metastasis.","authors":["Eckert MA","Lwin TM","Chang AT","Kim J","Danis E","Ohno-Machado L","Yang J"],"grantIds":["DP2 OD002420","DP2 OD002420-01","DP2OD002420-01","P30 CA023100","P30 CA23100","T32 CA077109","T32 CA077109-08","T32 GM007752","T32 GM007752-31"],"grantAgencies":["NIH HHS","NIH HHS","NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NIGMS NIH HHS","NIGMS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Cancer cell","journalShort":"Cancer Cell","day":8,"month":3,"year":2011,"meshHeadings":["Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport","Animals","Base Sequence","Breast Neoplasms","Cell Line","Cell Line, Tumor","Cell Movement","Cell Surface Extensions","Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel","Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition","Female","HEK293 Cells","Humans","Mice","Mice, Nude","Neoplasm Metastasis","Neoplasms","Nuclear Proteins","RNA Interference","Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha","Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction","Signal Transduction","Twist Transcription Factor","src Homology Domains"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"The Twist1 transcription factor is known to promote tumor metastasis and induce Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT).

To advance the use of DPSCs for dentin regeneration, it is important to replicate the permissive signals that drive terminal events in odontoblast differentiation during tooth development. Such a strategy is likely to restore a dentin matrix that more resembles the tubular nature of primary dentin. Due to the limitations of culture conditions, the use of ex vivo gene therapy to drive the terminal differentiation of mineralizing cells holds considerable promise. In these studies, we asked whether the forced expression of TWIST1 in DPSCs could alter the potential of these cells to differentiate into odontoblast-like cells. Since the partnership between Runx2 and Twist1 proteins is known to control the onset of osteoblast terminal differentiation, we hypothesized that these genes act to control lineage determination of DPSCs. For the first time, our results showed that Twist1 overexpression in DPSCs enhanced the expression of DSPP, a gene that marks odontoblast terminal differentiation. Furthermore, co-transfection assays showed that Twist1 stimulates Dspp promoter activity by antagonizing Runx2 function in 293FT cells. Analysis of our in vitro data, taken together, suggests that lineage specification of DPSCs can be modulated through ex vivo gene modifications.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"21864967","pmcid":null,"title":"Correlation of increased twist with lymph node metastasis in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma.","authors":["Wushou A","Pan HY","Liu W","Tian Z","Wang LZ","Shali S","Zhang ZY"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons","journalShort":"J.

The results were compared with estrogen and progesterone receptor status, HER2 amplification, grade, histology, TNM status and survival of the patients. RESULTS: Nuclear expression for twist was seen in the epithelial tumor cell compartment in 3.6% and for snai1 in 3.1% of the cases while zeb1 was not detected at all in these areas. In contrast, the tumor stromal compartment showed nuclear zeb1 and twist expression in 75% and 52.4% of the cases, respectively.

Both, however, were associated with their clinical nodal stages. In pN+ patients, Twist, VEGF-C, and VEGFR-3 expressions were 86.11% (31/36), 80.56% (29/36), and 58.33% (21/36), respectively. These values were higher than those found for pN0 patients (i.e., 13/30, 11/30, and 7/30, respectively) (P < 0.05). Among the samples with Twist expression, 88.64% were VEGF-C-positive and 59.09% were VEGFR-3-positive. The pN0 counterparts were 4.55% and 9.09%, respectively (P < 0.05). The expressions of Twist, VEGF-C, and VEGFR-3 in pN+ patients obtained through Western blotting analysis were significantly higher than those in pN0 patients, and the levels of VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 were positively correlated with that of Twist. CONCLUSIONS: Twist expression correlates with lymph node metastasis. The mechanism involved in such a correlation may be related to lymphangiogenesis.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"21503964","pmcid":null,"title":"The role of TWIST as a regulator in giant cell tumor of bone.","authors":["Singh S","Mak IW","Cowan RW","Turcotte R","Singh G","Ghert M"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Journal of cellular biochemistry","journalShort":"J.

Using GCT stromal cells obtained from patient specimens, we demonstrated that TWIST, a master osteogenic regulator, was highly expressed in all GCT specimens.

However, the mechanisms responsible for regulating Twist1 stability are unknown in these cells. We identified the serine 68 (Ser 68) as a major phosphorylation site of Twist1 by mass spectrometry and with specific antibodies. This Ser 68 is phosphorylated by p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinases1/2 in vitro, and its phosphorylation levels positively correlate with Twist1 protein levels in human embryonic kidney 293 and breast cancer cells. Prevention of Ser 68 phosphorylation by an alanine (A) mutation (Ser 68A) dramatically accelerates Twist1 ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) by an active Ras protein or TGF-β treatment significantly increases Ser 68 phosphorylation and Twist1 protein levels without altering Twist1 mRNA expression, whereas blocking of MAPK activities by either specific inhibitors or dominant negative inhibitory mutants effectively reduces the levels of both induced and uninduced Ser 68 phosphorylation and Twist protein. Accordingly, the mammary epithelial cells expressing Twist1 exhibit much higher degrees of EMT and invasiveness on stimulation with TGF-β or the active Ras and paclitaxel resistance compared with the same cells expressing the Ser 68A-Twist1 mutant. Importantly, the levels of Ser 68 phosphorylation in the invasive human breast ductal carcinomas positively correlate with the levels of Twist1 protein and JNK activity and are significantly higher in progesterone receptor-negative and HER2-positive breast cancers. These findings suggest that activation of MAPKs by tyrosine kinase receptors and Ras signaling pathways may substantially promote breast tumor cell EMT and metastasis via phoshorylation and stabilization of Twist1.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"21594904","pmcid":null,"title":"Involvement of the transcription factor twist in phenotype alteration through epithelial-mesenchymal transition in lung cancer cells.","authors":["Nakashima H","Hashimoto N","Aoyama D","Kohnoh T","Sakamoto K","Kusunose M","Imaizumi K","Takeyama Y","Sato M","Kawabe T","Hasegawa Y"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Molecular carcinogenesis","journalShort":"Mol.

Although recent studies suggest that twist expression levels in tissue specimens of lung cancer might be associated with prognosis, the expression of twist in lung cancer cells itself and its effect have not been fully evaluated. Here, we evaluated twist expression and its effect on phenotype alteration in lung cancer cell lines. Twist expression varied among human lung cancer cell lines. The lung cancer cell lines with high twist expression also tended to show a high vimentin/E-cadherin ratio, which was supported by a migration assay, in which high twist expression gave rise to high cell motility. Furthermore, in comparison to control cells, the lung cancer cells with ectopic expression of twist showed a significant phenotype alteration through EMT and an increasing ability to migrate in vitro, in part, due to a tenfold increase in matrix metalloproteinases activity and almost a 60% increase in modulation of focal adhesion kinase activity, although a contribution of microRNA appeared unlikely in our study.

RESULTS: Tumors with intense stromal staining of TWIST relapsed more frequently (p = 0.04). Tumors with both positive TWIST and SNAI1 immunoreactivity in the stroma were at least Stage II (p = 0.05) and located more often in hypopharynx (p = 0.035). Tumors with negative immunostaining of TWIST and SNAI1 in the stromal compartment were smaller (T1-2) (p = 0.008), less advanced (SI-II) (p = 0.031) and located more often in the oropharynx (p = 0.007).

Twist1 expression was more frequently observed in gastric cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) than in other cancer cells but was otherwise rarely expressed in noncancerous tissue. In laser capture microdissection of stromal fibroblasts, Twist1 immunopositive fibroblasts exhibited significantly increased Twist1, fibroblast-specific protein 1, and CXCL14 mRNA expression. Furthermore, Twist1 mRNA expression showed a significant linear correlation with that of platelet-derived growth factor receptors β and α. We found that conditioned media from Twist1-expressing skin and lung fibroblasts significantly promote invasion of gastric cancer cells in vitro. In 195 gastric cancer samples, CAF Twist1 expression was associated with tumor size, invasion depth, and lymph node metastasis. Twist1 was also associated with poor prognosis in patients with gastric cancer, particularly in those with the diffuse type. In conclusion, CAFs in gastric cancer frequently have altered Twist1 expression, and increased Twist1 expression in fibroblasts contributes to the progression of cancer cells and poor patient survival.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"21539816","pmcid":null,"title":"Role of Twist in vasculogenic mimicry formation in hypoxic hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro.","authors":["Ma JL","Han SX","Zhu Q","Zhao J","Zhang D","Wang L","Lv Y"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Biochemical and biophysical research communications","journalShort":"Biochem.

We examined the prognostic value of these factors as well as E-cadherin and N-cadherin, in a well-described large cohort of breast cancer patients treated with primary surgery. Analyses were stratified by estrogen receptor (ER) status, because of its crucial role in the regulation of these transcription factors. SNAIL, SLUG, and TWIST expression were examined on a TMA containing 575 breast tumors using immunohistochemistry. Nuclear expression was quantified using a weighted histoscore and classified as high versus low expression, based on the median histoscore. High expression of SNAIL, SLUG, and TWIST was seen in 54, 50, and 50% of tumors, respectively. The level of SNAIL (P = 0.014) and TWIST (P = 0.006) expression was associated with a worse patient relapse-free period, specifically in patients with ER-positive tumors (interaction Cox proportional hazards P = 0.039). Combining both factors resulted in an independent prognostic factor with high discriminative power (both low versus either high: HR 1.15; both low versus both high HR 1.84; P = 0.010).

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to examine the role of Twist, a transcription factor identified as a key repressor of E-cadherin expression, in the differentiation of human trophoblastic cells. DESIGN: The expression of Twist or E-cadherin were first examined in first-trimester chorionic villi by immunohistochemistry. Gain- or loss-of-function studies on Twist were then performed in BeWo choriocarcinoma cells. The presence or absence of multinucleated syncytium was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence using antibodies directed against Twist, E-cadherin, or desmoplakin, a cellular marker of mononucleate cytotrophoblasts. RESULTS: The formation of multinucleated syncytium was associated with increased Twist and a decreased E-cadherin expression. Similarly, exogenous expression of Twist resulted in a continuous and progressive decrease in E-cadherin expression and the subsequent formation of syncytium in BeWo cells maintained under normal culture conditions.
