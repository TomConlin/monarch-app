However, it is not clear whether the full-length Gli3 is an activator in vivo and plays any role in the limb patterning.

The full-length Gli3 protein can also activate Shh target gene expression without Shh.

The resulting facial and neural tube phenotypes support the conclusion that the primary and probably exclusive role for Disp1 is within hedgehog protein-producing cells.

Intricate regulation of signaling pathways, transcription factors, and epithelial-mesenchymal cross-talk are critical to ensuring branching morphogenesis occurs properly. Here, we describe a role for the transcription factor Sox9 during lung branching morphogenesis. Sox9 is expressed at the distal tips of the branching epithelium in a highly dynamic manner as branching occurs and is down-regulated starting at embryonic day 16.5, concurrent with the onset of terminal differentiation of type 1 and type 2 alveolar cells. Using epithelial-specific genetic loss- and gain-of-function approaches, our results demonstrate that Sox9 controls multiple aspects of lung branching. Fine regulation of Sox9 levels is required to balance proliferation and differentiation of epithelial tip progenitor cells, and loss of Sox9 leads to direct and indirect cellular defects including extracellular matrix defects, cytoskeletal disorganization, and aberrant epithelial movement. Our evidence shows that unlike other endoderm-derived epithelial tissues, such as the intestine, Wnt/β-catenin signaling does not regulate Sox9 expression in the lung.

To determine the precise functional differences between Gli1 and Gli2, we have expressed Gli1 in place of Gli2 from the endogenous Gli2 locus in mice. Strikingly, a low level of Gli1 can rescue all the Shh signaling defects in Gli2 mutants; however, only in the presence of a wild-type Shh gene. These studies demonstrate that only the activator function of Gli2 is actually required, and indicates that in specific situations, Shh can modulate the ability of Gli1 to activate target genes. Furthermore, expression of both copies of Gli1 in place of Gli2 does not disrupt spinal cord patterning, but does result in new gain-of-function defects that lead to lethality. We show that the defects are enhanced when Gli3 function is reduced, demonstrating that an important difference between Gli1 and Gli2 is the ability of Gli1 to antagonize Gli3 function.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"16020517","pmcid":null,"title":"Cerebral hypoplasia and craniofacial defects in mice lacking heparan sulfate Ndst1 gene function.","authors":["Grobe K","Inatani M","Pallerla SR","Castagnola J","Yamaguchi Y","Esko JD"],"grantIds":["GM33063","HL57345","R01 NS41332"],"grantAgencies":["NIGMS NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NINDS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":3,"month":8,"year":2005,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Apoptosis","Brain","Cell Proliferation","Craniofacial Abnormalities","Embryo, Mammalian","Fibroblast Growth Factors","Gene Targeting","Hedgehog Proteins","Heparitin Sulfate","Humans","In Situ Hybridization","Mice","Mice, Knockout","Morphogenesis","Phenotype","Signal Transduction","Sulfotransferases","Trans-Activators"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Mutant mice bearing a targeted disruption of the heparan sulfate (HS) modifying enzyme GlcNAc N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase 1 (Ndst1) exhibit severe developmental defects of the forebrain and forebrain-derived structures, including cerebral hypoplasia, lack of olfactory bulbs, eye defects and axon guidance errors.

Here we have used a hypomorphic allele in Disp1(Disp1(Delta)(2)), to extend our knowledge of Disp1 function in Hh-mediated patterning of the mammalian embryo. Through genetic combinations with null alleles of patched 1 (Ptch1), sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Indian hedgehog (Ihh), we demonstrate that Disp1 genetically interacts with Hh signaling components.

Analysis of neural tube patterning demonstrates a progressive loss of ventral cell identities that most likely reflects decreased Shh signaling as Disp1 levels are attenuated. Conversely, increasing available Shh ligand by decreasing Ptch1 dosage leads to the restoration of ventral cell types in Disp1(Delta2/Delta2) mutants.

Accordingly, ShhN/+ mutant telencephalic dorsal midline structures, including cortical hem, hippocampus and choroid plexus, either failed to form or were hypoplastic. Strikingly, ShhN/+ mutants displayed a spectrum of phenotypic features such as failure of anterior cerebral hemisphere to divide, hydrocephalus and cleft palate which have been observed in a human patient with milder HPE predicted to produce SHHN protein due to a truncation mutation in one SHH allele.

Use of the T (brachyury)-cre line led to Fgfr1 inactivation in all limb bud mesenchyme (LBM) cells during limb initiation. This mutant reveals FGFR1 function in two phases of limb development. In a nascent limb bud, FGFR1 promotes the length of the proximodistal (PD) axis while restricting the dimensions of the other two axes. It also serves an unexpected role in limiting LBM cell number in this early phase. Later on during limb outgrowth, FGFR1 is essential for the expansion of skeletal precursor population by maintaining cell survival. Use of mice carrying the sonic hedgehog(cre) (Shh(cre)) allele led to Fgfr1 inactivation in posterior LBM cells. This mutant allows us to test the role of Fgfr1 in gene expression regulation without disturbing limb bud growth.

While both GATA4 and GATA6 are expressed in an A-P gradient in the forelimb buds, the hindlimb buds principally express GATA6 in an A-P gradient.

Mutations in SHH underlie most familial (17%) cases of HPE; and, consistent with this, Shh is expressed in midline embryonic cells and tissues and their derivatives that are affected in HPE. It has long been recognized that a graded series of facial anomalies occurs within the clinical spectrum of HPE, as HPE is often found in patients together with other malformations such as acrania, anencephaly, and agnathia. However, it is not known if these phenotypes arise through a common etiology and pathogenesis. Here we demonstrate for the first time using mouse models that Hedgehog acyltransferase (Hhat) loss-of-function leads to holoprosencephaly together with acrania and agnathia, which mimics the severe condition observed in humans. Hhat is required for post-translational palmitoylation of Hedgehog (Hh) proteins; and, in the absence of Hhat, Hh secretion from producing cells is diminished. We show through downregulation of the Hh receptor Ptch1 that loss of Hhat perturbs long-range Hh signaling, which in turn disrupts Fgf, Bmp and Erk signaling. Collectively, this leads to abnormal patterning and extensive apoptosis within the craniofacial primordial, together with defects in cartilage and bone differentiation. Therefore our work shows that Hhat loss-of-function underscrores HPE; but more importantly it provides a mechanism for the co-occurrence of acrania, holoprosencephaly, and agnathia.

The initial ingrowth of the dental epithelium and its associated dental mesenchyme gives rise to the tooth bud. Next, the epithelial component folds to give the tooth its shape. Coincident with this process, adjacent epithelial and mesenchymal cells differentiate into enamel-secreting ameloblasts and dentin-secreting odontoblasts, respectively. Growth, morphogenesis and differentiation of the epithelium and mesenchyme are coordinated by secreted signaling proteins. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) encodes a signaling peptide which is present in the oral epithelium prior to invagination and in the tooth epithelium throughout its development. We have addressed the role of Shh in the developing tooth in mouse by using a conditional allele to remove Shh activity shortly after ingrowth of the dental epithelium. Reduction and then loss of Shh function results in a cap stage tooth rudiment in which the morphology is severely disrupted. The overall size of the tooth is reduced and both the lingual epithelial invagination and the dental cord are absent. However, the enamel knot, a putative organizer of crown formation, is present and expresses Fgf4, Wnt10b, Bmp2 and Lef1, as in the wild type. At birth, the size and the shape of the teeth are severely affected and the polarity and organization of the ameloblast and odontoblast layers is disrupted. However, both dentin- and enamel-specific markers are expressed and a large amount of tooth-specific extracellular matrix is produced. This observation was confirmed by grafting studies in which tooth rudiments were cultured for several days under kidney capsules. Under these conditions, both enamel and dentin were deposited even though the enamel and dentin layers remained disorganized. These studies demonstrate that Shh regulates growth and determines the shape of the tooth.

Development initiates with evagination of two ventral buds of foregut endoderm into the underlying splanchnic mesoderm. As the buds extend, they send out lateral branches at precise, invariant positions, establishing the primary airways and the lobes of each lung. Dichotomous branching leads to further extension of the airways. Grafting studies have demonstrated the importance of bronchial mesenchyme in inducing epithelial branching, but the significance of epithelial signaling has largely been unstudied. The morphogen Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is widely expressed in the foregut endoderm and is specifically upregulated in the distal epithelium of the lung where branching is occurring [2]. Ectopic expression of Shh disrupts branching and increases proliferation, suggesting that local Shh signaling regulates lung development [2]. We report here that Shh is essential for development of the respiratory system. In Shh null mutants, we found that the trachea and esophagus do not separate properly and the lungs form a rudimentary sac due to failure of branching and growth after formation of the primary lung buds. Interestingly, normal proximo-distal differentiation of the airway epithelium occurred, indicating that Shh is not needed for differentiation events. In addition, the transcription of several mesenchymally expressed downstream targets of Shh is abolished. These results highlight the importance of epithelially derived Shh in regulating branching morphogenesis of the lung.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"18262513","pmcid":null,"title":"Impaired skin and hair follicle development in Runx2 deficient mice.","authors":["Glotzer DJ","Zelzer E","Olsen BR"],"grantIds":["AR 36820","AR36819","R01 AR036819","R01 AR036819-19","R01 AR036819-20","R01 AR036819-21","R01 AR036819-22","R01 AR036819-23","R01 AR036820","R01 AR036820-19","R01 AR036820-20","R01 AR036820-21","R01 AR036820-22","R01 AR036820-23"],"grantAgencies":["NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Developmental biology","journalShort":"Dev.

However, the molecular mechanisms that guide specification and differentiation of neurons in specific thalamic nuclei are still largely unknown, and few molecular markers are available for most of these thalamic subregions at early stages of development. We therefore searched for patterned gene expression restricted to specific mouse thalamic regions by in situ hybridization during the onset of thalamic neurogenesis (embryonic [E] days E10.5-E12.5). To obtain correct regional information, we used Shh as a landmark and compared spatial relationships with the zona limitans intrathalamica (Zli), the border of the p2 and p3 compartments of the diencephalon. We identified genes that are expressed specifically in the ventricular zone of the thalamic neuroepithelium and also identified a number of genes that already exhibited regional identity at E12.5. Although many genes expressed in the mantle regions of the thalamus at E12.5 showed regionally restricted patterns, none of these clearly corresponded to individual thalamic nuclei. We next examined gene expression at E15.5, when thalamocortical axons (TCAs) project from distinct regions of the thalamus and reach their targets in the cerebral cortex. Regionally restricted patterns of gene expression were again seen for many genes, but some regionally bounded expression patterns in the early postnatal thalamus had shifted substantially by E15.5.

In each case the specific structure (for example scale, feather or hair) arises from an epidermal placode as a result of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions with the underlying dermal mesenchyme. Expression of members of the Wnt, Hedgehog and bone morphogenetic protein families (Wnt10b, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Bmp2/Bmp4, respectively) in the epidermis correlates with the initiation of hair follicle formation. Further, their expression continues into either the epidermally derived hair matrix which forms the hair itself, or the dermal papilla which is responsible for induction of the hair matrix. To address the role of Shh in the hair follicle, we have examined Shh null mutant mice. RESULTS: We found that follicle development in the Shh mutant embryo arrested after the initial epidermal-dermal interactions that lead to the formation of a dermal papilla anlage and ingrowth of the epidermis. Wnt10b, Bmp2 and Bmp4 continued to be expressed at this time, however. When grafted to nude mice (which lack T cells), Shh mutant skin gave rise to large abnormal follicles containing a small dermal papilla. Although these follicles showed high rates of proliferation and some differentiation of hair matrix cells into hair-shaft-like material, no hair was formed.

Furthermore, their causative factors remain unclear. In this study, the involvement of the coordinated actions of androgen and the growth factor systems was genetically analyzed for the first time on mammalian reproductive organ formation. The results demonstrated that the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is indispensable masculine factor for the external genital development. The bilateral mesenchymal region adjacent to the urethral plate epithelium displayed a sexually dimorphic activity of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Loss- and gain-of-function beta-catenin mutants displayed altered sexual development of the external genitalia. These results indicate the novel functions of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway as a locally expressed masculine effector. This could be the first genetic study analyzing the roles of the genetic interactions between androgen and locally expressed growth factor signaling during the development of reproductive organs. These results also shed new insight on the reproductive genetics and the causative factors of genital disorders.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"19357274","pmcid":null,"title":"Sonic hedgehog signaling controls thalamic progenitor identity and nuclei specification in mice.","authors":["Vue TY","Bluske K","Alishahi A","Yang LL","Koyano-Nakagawa N","Novitch B","Nakagawa Y"],"grantIds":["R01 NS 049357","R01 NS049357","R01 NS049357-01A2","R01 NS049357-02","R01 NS049357-03","R01 NS049357-04","R01 NS053976","R21 MH078998"],"grantAgencies":["NINDS NIH HHS","NINDS NIH HHS","NINDS NIH HHS","NINDS NIH HHS","NINDS NIH HHS","NINDS NIH HHS","NINDS NIH HHS","NIMH NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","journalShort":"J.

The majority of these nuclei project axons to the neocortex in unique patterns and play critical roles in sensory, motor, and cognitive functions. It has been assumed that the adult thalamus is derived from neural progenitor cells located within the alar plate of the caudal diencephalon. Nevertheless, how a distinct array of postmitotic thalamic nuclei emerge from this single developmental unit has remained largely unknown. Our recent studies found that these thalamic nuclei are in fact derived from molecularly heterogeneous populations of progenitor cells distributed within at least two distinct progenitor domains in the caudal diencephalon. In this study, we investigated how such molecular heterogeneity is established and maintained during early development of the thalamus and how early signaling mechanisms influence the formation of postmitotic thalamic nuclei. By using mouse genetics and in utero electroporation, we provide evidence that Sonic hedgehog (Shh), which is normally expressed in ventral and rostral borders of the embryonic thalamus, plays a crucial role in patterning progenitor domains throughout the thalamus. We also show that increasing or decreasing Shh activity causes dramatic reorganization of postmitotic thalamic nuclei through altering the positional identity of progenitor cells.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"17344228","pmcid":null,"title":"Independent requirements for Hedgehog signaling by both the anterior heart field and neural crest cells for outflow tract development.","authors":["Goddeeris MM","Schwartz R","Klingensmith J","Meyers EN"],"grantIds":["HD480305","HL086853"],"grantAgencies":["NICHD NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":23,"month":4,"year":2007,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Arteries","Branchial Region","Endoderm","Heart","Hedgehog Proteins","Homeodomain Proteins","Mice","Mice, Knockout","Morphogenesis","Myocardium","Myocytes, Cardiac","Neural Crest","Signal Transduction","Transcription Factors"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Cardiac outflow tract (OFT) septation is crucial to the formation of the aortic and pulmonary arteries.

In this study, we first generated mutant mice in which Sox9 was misexpressed in the limb bud mesenchyme. The mutant mouse embryos exhibited polydactyly in limb buds in association with ectopic expression of Sox5 and Sox6 although markers for the different axes of limb bud development showed a normal pattern of expression. Misexpression of Sox9 stimulated cell proliferation in limb bud mesenchyme, suggesting that Sox9 has a role in recruiting mesenchymal cells to mesenchymal condensation.

To address this issue, we inactivated Notch signaling conditionally in the endoderm using a Shh-Cre deleter mouse line and mice carrying floxed alleles of the Pofut1 gene, which encodes an O-fucosyltransferase essential for Notch-ligand binding. We also took the same conditional approach to inactivate expression of Rbpjk, which encodes the transcriptional effector of canonical Notch signaling. Strikingly, these mutants showed an almost identical lung phenotype characterized by an absence of secretory Clara cells without evidence of cell death, and showed airways populated essentially by ciliated cells, with an increase in neuroendocrine cells. This phenotype could be further replicated in cultured wild-type lungs by disrupting Notch signaling with a gamma-secretase inhibitor. Our data suggest that Notch acts when commitment to a ciliated or non-ciliated cell fate occurs in proximal progenitors, silencing the ciliated program in the cells that will continue to expand and differentiate into secretory cells. This mechanism may be crucial to define the balance of differentiated cell profiles in different generations of the developing airways.

Pathogenesis was investigated during developmental stages 16 through 22 (11th through 15th days of gestation). Full expression was apparent during stage 20 when the limb pattern was comprised of pre-cartilaginous anlagen. Formation of a pre-axial protrusion on the autopod during stage 17 or 18 was the earliest gross abnormality, and foreshadowed the development of supernumerary digits. Microscopically, there was an alteration in the pattern of physiologic cellular degeneration (PCD) programmed to occur within the zeugopod and autopod. The 'opaque patch' (mesodermal necrotic zone normally occurring between tibial and fibular anlagen) was overextended pre-axially causing resorption of the tibial precartilage. Additionally, PCD normally occurring within the basal cell layer of the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) and the 'foyer primaire préaxial' was not expressed in the mutant autopod. This occurred in association with outgrowth of the protrusion. The pre-axial portion of the AER remained in an abnormally thickened, viable, proliferative state, and did not undergo scheduled degression. This may have been the basis for prolonged induction of pre-axial outgrowth. Paucity of mesenchymal cell filopodial processes extended along the basal lamina, as well as a rarefaction of the filamentous material normally associated with the mesodermal face of the basal lamina, was detected at the pre-axial AER-mesenchymal interface on stage 18.

Since the secreted factor sonic hedgehog (Shh) is expressed in Purkinje cells and functions as a GCP mitogen in vitro, it is possible that Shh influences foliation during cerebellum development by regulating the position and/or size of lobes. We studied how Shh and its transcriptional mediators, the Gli proteins, regulate GCP proliferation in vivo, and tested whether they influence foliation. We demonstrate that Shh expression correlates spatially and temporally with foliation. Expression of the Shh target gene Gli1 is also highest in the anterior medial cerebellum, but is restricted to proliferating GCPs and Bergmann glia. By contrast, Gli2 is expressed uniformly in all cells in the developing cerebellum except Purkinje cells and Gli3 is broadly expressed along the anteroposterior axis. Whereas Gli mutants have a normal cerebellum, Gli2 mutants have greatly reduced foliation at birth and a decrease in GCPs. In a complementary study using transgenic mice, we show that overexpressing Shh in the normal domain does not grossly alter the basic foliation pattern, but does lead to prolonged proliferation of GCPs and an increase in the overall size of the cerebellum. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that positive Shh signaling through Gli2 is required to generate a sufficient number of GCPs for proper lobe growth.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"20386744","pmcid":"2851570","title":"Distinct roles of Hand2 in initiating polarity and posterior Shh expression during the onset of mouse limb bud development.","authors":["Galli A","Robay D","Osterwalder M","Bao X","Bénazet JD","Tariq M","Paro R","Mackem S","Zeller R"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"PLoS genetics","journalShort":"PLoS Genet.","day":13,"month":4,"year":2010,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors","Body Patterning","Chromatin","Embryo, Mammalian","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Hedgehog Proteins","Homeodomain Proteins","Limb Buds","Mice","Mice, Transgenic","Mutation","Transcription Factors"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"The polarization of nascent embryonic fields and the endowment of cells with organizer properties are key to initiation of vertebrate organogenesis. One such event is antero-posterior (AP) polarization of early limb buds and activation of morphogenetic Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling in the posterior mesenchyme, which in turn promotes outgrowth and specifies the pentadactylous autopod. Inactivation of the Hand2 transcriptional regulator from the onset of mouse forelimb bud development disrupts establishment of posterior identity and Shh expression, which results in a skeletal phenotype identical to Shh deficient limb buds. In wild-type limb buds, Hand2 is part of the protein complexes containing Hoxd13, another essential regulator of Shh activation in limb buds. Chromatin immunoprecipitation shows that Hand2-containing chromatin complexes are bound to the far upstream cis-regulatory region (ZRS), which is specifically required for Shh expression in the limb bud. Cell-biochemical studies indicate that Hand2 and Hoxd13 can efficiently transactivate gene expression via the ZRS, while the Gli3 repressor isoform interferes with this positive transcriptional regulation. Indeed, analysis of mouse forelimb buds lacking both Hand2 and Gli3 reveals the complete absence of antero-posterior (AP) polarity along the entire proximo-distal axis and extreme digit polydactyly without AP identities. Our study uncovers essential components of the transcriptional machinery and key interactions that set-up limb bud asymmetry upstream of establishing the SHH signaling limb bud organizer.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"12231626","pmcid":null,"title":"Specification of the mammalian cochlea is dependent on Sonic hedgehog.","authors":["Riccomagno MM","Martinu L","Mulheisen M","Wu DK","Epstein DJ"],"grantIds":["R01 NS39421"],"grantAgencies":["NINDS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Genes & development","journalShort":"Genes Dev.","day":15,"month":9,"year":2002,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Body Patterning","Cochlea","DNA-Binding Proteins","Ear, Inner","Ganglia","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Hedgehog Proteins","Mice","Mice, Knockout","Mice, Transgenic","Models, Biological","PAX2 Transcription Factor","Signal Transduction","Trans-Activators","Transcription Factors","Tretinoin"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Organization of the inner ear into auditory and vestibular components is dependent on localized patterns of gene expression within the otic vesicle.

Because numerous mandibular derivatives (e.g., teeth, tongue, Meckel's cartilage) are absent in Shh null mice and the embryonic submandibular salivary gland (SMG) develops from the mandibular arch, we postulated that Shh signaling is important for embryonic SMG development. To address this question, we first determined the spatiotemporal distribution of Shh; two transmembrane proteins, patched 1 (Ptc) and Smoothened (Smo), which act as a negative or a positive regulator of the Shh signal, respectively; and the Gli 3 transcription factor, which is downstream of the Shh signal. The epithelial localization of Shh, Ptc, Smo, and Gli 3 suggests that Shh signaling may act within the epithelium in a juxtacrine manner. The SMG phenotype in our embryonic day (E) 18.5 Shh null mice can be characterized as \"paedomorphic,\" that is, it fails to progress to ontogenic stages beyond the Early Pseudoglandular ( approximately E14). In a complementary set of experiments, we used organ culture to evaluate the effect of enhanced or abrogated Shh signaling on embryonic SMG development in vitro. Paired E13 (Late Initial Bud stage) or E14 (Pseudoglandular stage) SMGs were cultured in the presence or absence of exogenous Shh peptide supplementation; Shh-supplemented explants exhibit a significant stage-dependent increase in branching morphogenesis compared with control explants. Furthermore, by using cyclopamine, a steroidal alkaloid that specifically disrupts the Shh pathway, to abrogate endogenous Shh signaling in vitro, we found a significant decrease in branching in cyclopamine-treated explants compared with controls, as well as a significant decrease in epithelial cell proliferation. Our results indicate that Shh signaling plays an essential role during embryonic SMG branching morphogenesis. Exogenous FGF8 peptide supplementation in vitro rescues the abnormal SMG phenotype seen in cyclopamine-treated explants, demonstrating that overexpression of a parallel, but related, downstream signaling pathway can compensate for diminished Shh signaling and restore embryonic SMG branching morphogenesis.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"23090636","pmcid":null,"title":"Sonic Hedgehog contributes to gastric mucosal restitution after injury.","authors":["Xiao C","Feng R","Engevik AC","Martin JR","Tritschler JA","Schumacher M","Koncar R","Roland J","Nam KT","Goldenring JR","Zavros Y"],"grantIds":["1R01DK083402","AR-47363","CA68485","DK078392","P30 CA068485","P30 DK058404","P30 DK58404","R01 DK071590","R01 DK071590","R01 DK083402"],"grantAgencies":["NIDDK NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology","journalShort":"Lab.

Upregulation of patched 1, the sonic hedgehog receptor and a downstream target gene of the signaling pathway in the mesenchyme surrounding the distal collecting ducts and the ureter suggests that sonic hedgehog acts as a paracrine signal. In vivo and in vitro analyses demonstrate that sonic hedgehog promotes mesenchymal cell proliferation, regulates the timing of differentiation of smooth muscle progenitor cells, and sets the pattern of mesenchymal differentiation through its dose-dependent inhibition of smooth muscle formation. In addition, we also show that bone morphogenetic protein 4 is a downstream target gene of sonic hedgehog signaling in kidney stroma and ureteral mesenchyme, but does not mediate the effects of sonic hedgehog in the control of mesenchymal proliferation.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"11572986","pmcid":null,"title":"Evidence that the WNT-inducible growth arrest-specific gene 1 encodes an antagonist of sonic hedgehog signaling in the somite.","authors":["Lee CS","Buttitta L","Fan CM"],"grantIds":["R01HD/GM35596"],"grantAgencies":["NICHD NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","journalShort":"Proc.

It has been shown that Wnt1 and Lmx1a participate in a cross-regulatory loop that is utilized during MbDA neuron development. However, Wnt1 expression dynamically changes over time and precedes that of Lmx1a. The spatial and temporal requirements of Wnt1 in development and specifically its requirement for MbDA neurons remain to be determined. To address these issues, we generated a conditional Wnt1 allele and temporally deleted Wnt1 coupled with genetic lineage analysis. Using this approach, we show that patterning of the midbrain (Mb) and Cb by Wnt1 occurs between the one-somite and the six- to eight-somite stages and is solely dependent on Wnt1 function in the Mb, but not in the Cb. Interestingly, an En1-derived domain persists after the early deletion of Wnt1 and mutant cells express OTX2. However, the En1-derived Wnt1-mutant domain does not contain LMX1a-expressing progenitors, and MbDA neurons are depleted. Thus, we demonstrate an early requirement of Wnt1 for all MbDA neurons. Subsequently, we deleted Wnt1 in the ventral Mb and show a continued late requirement for Wnt1 in MbDA neuron development, but not in LMX1a-expressing progenitors. Specifically, Wnt1 deletion disrupts the birthdating of MbDA neurons and causes a depletion of MbDA neurons positioned medially and a concomitant expansion of MbDA neurons positioned laterally during embryogenesis. Collectively, our analyses resolve the spatial and temporal function of Wnt1 in Mb and Cb patterning and in MbDA neuron development in vivo.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"11960000","pmcid":null,"title":"Suppressor of Fused represses Gli-mediated transcription by recruiting the SAP18-mSin3 corepressor complex.","authors":["Cheng SY","Bishop JM"],"grantIds":["CA44338"],"grantAgencies":["NCI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","journalShort":"Proc.

To investigate the functional significance of Shh in adrenal growth, we ablated Shh in an adrenocortex-specific manner using the Steroidogenic factor 1-Cre mouse. Loss of Shh in the adrenocortex led to reduced proliferation of capsular cells and a 50-75% reduction in adrenocortex thickness and adrenal size. The remaining adrenocortex underwent proper zonation and was able to synthesize steroids, indicating that Shh is dispensable for differentiation of adrenocortex. When these animals reached adulthood, their adrenocortex did not undergo compensatory growth in response to a high level of plasma ACTH, and the size of the adrenal remained significantly smaller than the control adrenal.

Hip encodes a membrane glycoprotein that binds to all three mammalian Hedgehog proteins with an affinity comparable to that of Ptc-1. Hip-expressing cells are located next to cells that express each Hedgehog gene. Hip expression is induced by ectopic Hedgehog signalling and is lost in Hedgehog mutants.

To assess the possible involvement of HNF1 and/or vHNF1 as transcriptional regulators in the early steps of visceral endoderm differentiation, we have analyzed the expression pattern of both factors both in vitro during differentiation of murine F9 embryonal carcinoma cells and in vivo during early postimplantation mouse development. We show here that differentiation of F9 cells into either visceral or parietal endoderm is accompanied by a sharp induction in vHNF1 mRNA and protein. By contrast, only low levels of aberrantly sized HNF1 transcripts, but not DNA-binding protein, are found in F9 cells and its differentiated derivatives. At 6-7.5 days of gestation, high levels of vHNF1 mRNA are present in the visceral extraembryonic endoderm, which co-localize with transcripts of the transthyretin gene. HNF1 transcripts are first detected in the yolk sac roughly two embryonic days later, after the developmental onset of transcription of target genes. As development proceeds, discrepancies are observed between the level of transcripts of both vHNF1 and HNF1 and their respective nuclear binding proteins, notably in the yolk sac and embryonic kidney. In addition, we show that two alternative spliced isoforms of vHNF1 mRNA, vHNF-A and vHNF1-B, are expressed in both embryonic and adult tissues. Taken together, these data suggest that vHNF1 participates as a regulatory factor in the initial transcriptional activation of the target genes in the visceral endoderm of the yolk sac, whereas the later appearance of HNF1 could be required for maintenance of their expression.

Furthermore, we have compared Hh expression with that of a second family of signaling molecules, the Bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmps), vertebrate relatives of decapentaplegic, a target of the Drosophila Hh signaling pathway. The frequent expression of Bmp-2, -4, and -6 in similar or adjacent cell populations suggests a conserved role for Hh/Bmp interactions in vertebrate development.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"7671817","pmcid":null,"title":"Distribution of Sonic hedgehog peptides in the developing chick and mouse embryo.","authors":["Martí E","Takada R","Bumcrot DA","Sasaki H","McMahon AP"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":13,"month":8,"year":1995,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Blotting, Western","Central Nervous System","Chick Embryo","Extremities","Hedgehog Proteins","Immunohistochemistry","In Situ Hybridization","Mesoderm","Mice","Morphogenesis","Proteins","Species Specificity","Trans-Activators"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Sonic hedgehog (Shh) encodes a signal that is implicated in both short- and long-range interactions that pattern the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS), somite and limb.

We have investigated the distribution of Shh peptides with respect to these patterning events using peptide-specific antibodies. Immunostaining of chick and mouse embryos indicates that Shh peptides are expressed in the notochord, floor plate and posterior mesenchyme of the limb at the appropriate times for their postulated patterning functions. The amino peptide that is implicated in intercellular signaling is secreted but remains tightly associated with expressing cells. The distribution of peptides in the ventral CNS is polarized with the highest levels of protein accumulating towards the luminal surface. Interestingly, Shh expression extends beyond the floor plate, into ventrolateral regions from which some motor neuron precursors are emerging. In the limb bud, peptides are restricted to a small region of posterior-distal mesenchyme in close association with the apical ectodermal ridge; a region that extends 50-75 microns along the anterior-posterior axis. Temporal expression of Shh peptides is consistent with induction of sclerotome in somites and floor plate and motor neurons in the CNS, as well as the regulation of anterior-posterior polarity in the limb. However, we can find no direct evidence for long-range diffusion of the 19 x 10(3) Mr peptide which is thought to mediate both short- and long-range cell interactions. Thus, either long-range signaling is mediated indirectly by the activation of other signals, or alternatively the low levels of diffusing peptide are undetectable using available techniques.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"7590255","pmcid":null,"title":"BMP-7 is an inducer of nephrogenesis, and is also required for eye development and skeletal patterning.","authors":["Luo G","Hofmann C","Bronckers AL","Sohocki M","Bradley A","Karsenty G"],"grantIds":["AR-41059","HD20209"],"grantAgencies":["NIAMS NIH HHS","NICHD NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Genes & development","journalShort":"Genes Dev.","day":15,"month":11,"year":1995,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Bone Morphogenetic Protein 7","Bone Morphogenetic Proteins","Eye","Female","Kidney","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Phenotype","Proteins","Transforming Growth Factor beta"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are multifunctional growth factors originally identified by their ability to induce ectopic bone formation.

Severe malformations in the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia were observed in the thoracic region. The spinal cord of opb mutant embryos exhibited an abnormal circular to oval shape and showed defects in both ventral and dorsal regions.

The limb defects, oligodactyly and syndactyly, have been traced to improper differentiation of the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) and shortening of the anteroposterior limb axis. The renal defects, usually aplasia, are thought to result from failure of ureteric bud outgrowth. Since the ld locus gives rise to multiple RNA isoforms encoding several different proteins (termed formins), we wished to understand their role in the formation of these organs. Therefore, we first examined the embryonic expression patterns of the four major ld mRNA isoforms. Isoforms I, II and III (all containing a basic amino terminus) are expressed in dorsal root ganglia, cranial ganglia and the developing kidney including the ureteric bud. Isoform IV (containing an acidic amino terminus) is expressed in the notochord, the somites, the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) of the limb bud and the developing kidney including the ureteric bud. Using a lacZ reporter assay in transgenic mice, we show that this differential expression of isoform IV results from distinct regulatory sequences upstream of its first exon. These expression patterns suggest that all four isoforms may be involved in ureteric bud outgrowth, while isoform IV may be involved in AER differentiation. To define further the developmental consequences of the ld limb defect, we analyzed the expression of a number of genes thought to play a role in limb development. Most significantly, we find that although the AERs of ld limb buds express several AER markers, they do not express detectable levels of fibroblast growth factor 4 (fgf-4), which has been proposed to be the AER signal to the mesoderm. Thus we conclude that one or more formins are necessary to initiate and/or maintain fgf-4 production in the distal limb. Since ld limbs form distal structures such as digits, we further conclude that while fgf-4 is capable of supporting distal limb outgrowth in manipulated limbs, it is not essential for distal outgrowth in normal limb development. In addition, ld limbs show a severe decrease in the expression of several mesodermal markers, including sonic hedgehog (shh), a marker for the polarizing region and Hoxd-12, a marker for posterior mesoderm. We propose that incomplete differentiation of the AER in ld limb buds leads to reduction of polarizing activity and defects along the anteroposterior axis.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"7619528","pmcid":null,"title":"Induction of midbrain dopaminergic neurons by Sonic hedgehog.","authors":["Hynes M","Porter JA","Chiang C","Chang D","Tessier-Lavigne M","Beachy PA","Rosenthal A"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Neuron","journalShort":"Neuron","day":25,"month":7,"year":1995,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Cells, Cultured","Culture Media","Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases","Dopamine","Embryonic Induction","Hedgehog Proteins","In Situ Hybridization","Mesencephalon","Mice","Neurons","Peptide Fragments","Proteins","Rats","Recombinant Proteins","Trans-Activators"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Midbrain dopaminergic neurons, whose loss in adults results in Parkinson's disease, can be specified during embryonic development by a contact-dependent signal from floor plate cells.

High concentrations of Shh bound to a matrix induce floor plate and motor neurons, and addition of Shh to the medium leads to dose-dependent induction of motor neurons.

In this report, we investigate the biochemical behavior of Shh in a variety of expression systems and embryonic tissues. Expression of mouse Shh in Xenopus oocytes, COS cells, and baculovirus-infected insect cells demonstrates that in addition to signal peptide cleavage and N-linked glycosylation, chicken and mouse Shh proteins undergo additional proteolytic processing to yield two peptides with molecular masses of approximately 19 kDa (amino terminus) and 27 kDa (carboxy terminus), both of which are secreted. In transfected COS cells, we show that the 19-kDa peptide does not accumulate significantly in the medium unless heparin or suramin is added, suggesting that this peptide associates with the cell surface or extracellular matrix. This retention appears to depend on sequences in the carboxy-terminal part of the peptide. Finally, detection of the 19-kDa product in a variety of mouse and chicken embryonic tissues demonstrates that the proteolytic processing observed in cell culture is a normal aspect of Shh processing in embryonic development.

We have also isolated three mouse and two human DNA fragments encoding distinct hh-like sequences. Our studies have focused upon Hhg-1, a mouse gene encoding a protein with 46% amino acid identity to hh. The Hhg-1 gene, which corresponds to the previously described vhh-1 or sonic class, is expressed in the notochord, ventral neural tube, lung bud, hindgut and posterior margin of the limb bud in developing mouse embryos. By segregation analysis the Hhg-1 gene has been localized to a region in proximal chromosome 5, where two mutations affecting mouse limb development previously have been mapped. In Drosophila embryos, ubiquitous expression of the Hhg-1 gene yields effects upon gene expression and cuticle pattern similar to those observed for the Drosophila hh gene. We also find that cultured quail cells transfected with a Hhg-1 expression construct can induce digit duplications when grafted to anterior or mid-distal but not posterior borders within the developing chick limb; more proximal limb element duplications are induced exclusively by mid-distal grafts.

Mouse embryos homozygous for a mutation in the RXR alpha gene appear normal in limb development, although such embryos are phenotypically affected in other tissues. We now describe resistance to limb malformations normally induced by teratogenic RA exposure in the RXR alpha-/- background. RA treatments that cause limb defects in 100% of wild-type embryos fail to elicit malformations in RXR alpha homozygotes, implicating RXR alpha as a component in the teratogenic process in the limbs. Heterozygous embryos are intermediate in sensitivity to RA, suggesting the importance of RXR alpha gene dosage in limb teratogenesis.

In this essay, we describe studies of the expression of several genes in the mouse between 7.5 (presomite stage) and 10.5 days post coitum (dpc) that provide evidence for the trajectory of the anterior-posterior axis and the longitudinal organization of the anterior CNS. Specifically, we report that the expression of noggin, sonic hedgehog and Nkx-2.2 define longitudinal columns of cells that are present along the entire CNS axis. Within the forebrain, the expression of these genes, as well as that of Nkx-2.1 and BF-1, are in distinct longitudinal regions in the neural plate and tube. We demonstrate that the earliest longitudinal axon pathways of the forebrain are spatially correlated with the longitudinal domain defined by Nkx-2.2. Finally, expression of the former genes, and Otx-1 and Emx-2, suggests that the cephalic neural plate is organized into molecularly distinct domains delimited by longitudinal and transverse borders; these results provide a foundation for defining the mechanisms that pattern the neural plate.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"8069910","pmcid":null,"title":"The winged-helix transcription factor HNF-3 beta is required for notochord development in the mouse embryo.","authors":["Weinstein DC","Ruiz i Altaba A","Chen WS","Hoodless P","Prezioso VR","Jessell TM","Darnell JE"],"grantIds":["CA 16006","GM 07982-09","NS 30532"],"grantAgencies":["NCI NIH HHS","NIGMS NIH HHS","NINDS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Cell","journalShort":"Cell","day":26,"month":8,"year":1994,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Base Sequence","Cell Differentiation","Central Nervous System","Chimera","DNA-Binding Proteins","Female","Gastrula","Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 3-beta","Male","Mesoderm","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Molecular Sequence Data","Mutation","Notochord","Nuclear Proteins","Phenotype","Recombinant Fusion Proteins","Transcription Factors"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"HNF-3 beta, a transcription factor of the winged-helix family, is expressed in embryonic and adult endoderm and also in midline cells of the node, notochord, and floor plate in mouse embryos.

In addition, ectopic Sonic hedgehog expression in the mouse central nervous system induces ptc transcription. As in flies, mouse ptc transcription appears to be indicative of hedgehog signal reception. The results support the existence of a conserved signaling pathway used for pattern formation in insects and mammals.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"8579575","pmcid":null,"title":"Sonic hedgehog is expressed in epithelial cells during development of whisker, hair, and tooth.","authors":["Iseki S","Araga A","Ohuchi H","Nohno T","Yoshioka H","Hayashi F","Noji S"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Biochemical and biophysical research communications","journalShort":"Biochem.

Expression is first observed in the primitive ectoderm of the egg cylinder stage embryo. In gastrulating embryos, Oct-6 protein is found in the extra-embryonic ectoderm of the chorion and the anterior ectoderm of the embryo proper. As development proceeds, Oct-6 expression becomes more restricted to the anterior medial part of the embryo until Oct-6 positive cells are observed only in the neural groove of the headfold stage embryo. In the late headfold stage embryo, Oct-6 expression is detected in the neuroepithelium of the entire brain and later is restricted to a more ventral and anterior position. As the anterior neuropore closes, Oct-6 protein is detected in a segment-like pattern in the mid-and forebrain. Thus, the expression pattern of the Oct-6 gene agrees with a role for the Oct-6 protein in the establishment and regional specification of the neuroectoderm in vivo.

Most often, these arose as a pair of extra buds located caudally and ventrally to the normal (orthotopic) hindlimb buds without duplication of the lower body axis. The resulting one or two supernumerary hindlimbs were connected to an imperfectly mirror-image-duplicated pelvic girdle. Variable truncations of the stylopodium and zeugopodium skeleton, as well as abnormal splitting of the distal skeleton, were frequently observed. The apical ectodermal ridge of the extra limb buds expressed expected growth factor genes. However, an ectopic anterior expression of Sonic hedgehog and Hoxd-13 was seen in the supernumerary buds, suggesting that these buds would incorporate potential polarizing cells of the hindlimb or genital field and generate an ectopic polarizing zone. This is consistent with the reverse orientation of most supernumerary limbs at later stages. Some of the buds did not express limb-specific markers and were thus expected to degenerate or form nonlimb structures, as observed in an adult specimen. Less frequently, extra limb buds with normal polarity were associated to a duplicated lower body axis.

One of the vertebrate Hh family members, Sonic hedgehog (Shh), can induce ventral neural cell types both in vivo and in vitro; high concentrations induce floor plate and lower concentrations motor neurons. To investigate whether PKA plays an active role in the suppression of ventral neural differentiation, we generated transgenic embryos expressing a dominant negative form of PKA (dnPKA) in primarily dorsal aspects of the mouse CNS. Similar to our earlier results with Shh, we observed the induction of floor plate and motor neuron markers in embryos expressing the dominant negative PKA transgene and the loss of dorsal gene expression at rostral levels. Thus suppression of PKA activity is sufficient to activate targets of the Shh signaling pathway in the vertebrate CNS suggesting that induction of ventral cell types occurs via the antagonistic action of Shh on PKA activity. Two mammalian target genes that are strongly expressed in ectopic dorsal locations in response to dnPKA are Ptc and Gli.

ISL1 is also expressed in mesenchymal cells that surround the dorsal but not ventral evagination of the gut endoderm, which together comprise the pancreatic anlagen. To define the role of ISL1 in the development of the pancreas, we have now analysed acinar and islet cell differentiation in mice deficient in ISL1 function. Dorsal pancreatic mesenchyme does not form in ISL1-mutant embryos and there is an associated failure of exocrine cell differentiation in the dorsal but not the ventral pancreas. There is also a complete loss of differentiated islet cells. Exocrine, but not endocrine, cell differentiation in the dorsal pancreas can be rescued in vitro by provision of mesenchyme derived from wild-type embryos.

The expression of the three Zic genes was first detected at gastrulation in a spatially restricted manner. At neurulation, the expression became restricted to the dorsal neural ectoderm and dorsal paraxial mesoderm. During organogenesis, the three genes were expressed in specific regions of several developing organs, including dorsal areas of the brain, spinal cord, paraxial mesenchyme, and epidermis, the marginal zone of the neural retina and distal regions of the developing limb.

A critical event for floor plate development is the induction of a winged helix transcription factor, Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor-3beta (HNF-3beta). The enhancer for floor plate expression of HNF-3beta is located 3' of the transcription unit and consists of multiple elements. HNF-3beta induction depends on the notochord-derived signal, Sonic hedgehog (Shh). Genetic analysis in Drosophila has led to the identification of genes involved in the Hh signalling pathway, and cubitus interruptus (ci), encoding a protein with five zinc finger motifs, was placed downstream. In the present work, we test the involvement of Gli proteins, the mouse homologues of Ci, in activation of the floor plate enhancer of HNF-3beta. Transgenic analysis shows that a Gli-binding site is required for the activity of the minimal floor plate enhancer of HNF-3beta in vivo. Three Gli genes are differentially expressed in the developing neural tube. Gli expression is restricted to the ventral part, while Gli2 and Gli3 are expressed throughout the neural tube and dorsally, respectively. Strong Gli and Gli2, and weak Gli3 expressions transiently overlap with HNF-3beta at the time of its induction. Consistent with ventrally localized expression, Gli expression can be up-regulated by Shh in a cell line. Finally, the Gli-binding site acts as a Shh responsive element, and human GLI, but not GLI3, can activate this binding site in tissue culture. Taken together, these findings suggest that Gli, and probably also Gli2, are good candidates for transcriptional activators of the HNF-3beta floor plate enhancer, and the binding site for Gli proteins is a key element for response to Shh signalling. These results also support the idea that Gli/Ci are evolutionary conserved transcription factors in the Hedgehog signalling pathway.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"9019247","pmcid":null,"title":"Polarizing activity, Sonic hedgehog, and tooth development in embryonic and postnatal mouse.","authors":["Koyama E","Yamaai T","Iseki S","Ohuchi H","Nohno T","Yoshioka H","Hayashi Y","Leatherman JL","Golden EB","Noji S","Pacifici M"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists","journalShort":"Dev.

Because these processes bear similarities to those occurring in the developing limb, we asked whether morphogenetic signals found in the limb also occur in the developing tooth. We grafted mouse embryo tooth germs to the anterior margin of host chick embryo wing buds and determined whether the dental tissues had polarizing activity. Indeed, the grafts induced supernumerary digits. Activity of both molar and incisor tooth germs increased from bud to cap stages and was maximal at late bell stage in newborn. With further development the polarizing activity began to decrease, became undetectable in adult molar mesenchyme but persisted in incisor mesenchyme, correlating with the fact that incisors grow throughout postnatal life while molars do not. When different portions of neonatal incisors were assayed, a clear proximo-distal gradient of activity was apparent, with maximal activity restricted to the most proximal portion where undifferentiated mesenchyme and enamel organ reside. In situ hybridizations demonstrated that prior to induction of supernumerary digits, the tooth germ grafts induced expression in host tissue of Hoxd-12 and Hoxd-13. In addition, whole-mount in situ hybridizations and immunohistochemistry showed that developing tooth germs express Sonic hedgehog (Shh). Shh expression was first detected in bud stage tooth germs; at later stages Shh transcripts were prominent in enamel knot and differentiating ameloblasts at the cuspal region. We concluded that tooth germs possess polarizing activity and produce polarizing factors such as Shh. As in the limb, these factor(s) and activity probably play key roles in establishing polarity and regulating morphogenesis during early tooth development. Given its subsequent association with differentiating ameloblasts, Shh probably participates also in cytogenetic events during odontogenesis.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"9115210","pmcid":null,"title":"Basal cell carcinomas in mice overexpressing sonic hedgehog.","authors":["Oro AE","Higgins KM","Hu Z","Bonifas JM","Epstein EH","Scott MP"],"grantIds":["AR39959"],"grantAgencies":["NIAMS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","journalShort":"Science","day":2,"month":5,"year":1997,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome","Carcinoma, Basal Cell","Embryo, Mammalian","Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic","Hedgehog Proteins","Humans","Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins","Keratinocytes","Male","Membrane Proteins","Mice","Mice, SCID","Mice, Transgenic","Mutation","Neoplasm Transplantation","Protein Biosynthesis","Proteins","Receptors, Cell Surface","Skin","Skin Neoplasms","Skin Transplantation","Trans-Activators"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PATCHED (PTC) are found in human patients with the basal cell nevus syndrome, a disease causing developmental defects and tumors, including basal cell carcinomas.

These data suggest that SHH may have a role in human tumorigenesis.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"9006074","pmcid":null,"title":"Limb deformity proteins: role in mesodermal induction of the apical ectodermal ridge.","authors":["Kuhlman J","Niswander L"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":24,"month":1,"year":1997,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Chick Embryo","Chickens","Chimera","Ectoderm","Embryo, Nonmammalian","Embryonic Induction","Fibroblast Growth Factor 4","Fibroblast Growth Factor 8","Fibroblast Growth Factors","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Growth Substances","Hedgehog Proteins","Homeodomain Proteins","Limb Buds","Mesoderm","Mice","Mice, Mutant Strains","Muscle, Skeletal","Protein Biosynthesis","Proto-Oncogene Proteins","Quail","Trans-Activators","Transcription, Genetic","Wnt Proteins"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"During early limb development, distal tip ectoderm is induced by the underlying mesenchyme to form the apical ectodermal ridge. Subsequent limb growth and patterning depend on reciprocal signaling between the mesenchyme and ridge. Mice that are homozygous for mutations at the limb deformity (ld) locus do not form a proper ridge and the anteroposterior axis of the limb is shortened. Skeletal analyses reveal shortened limbs that involve loss and fusion of distal bones and digits, defects in both anteroposterior and proximodistal patterning. Using molecular markers and mouse-chick chimeras we examined the ridge-mesenchymal interactions to determine the origin of the ld patterning defects. In the ld ridge, fibroblast growth factor 8 (Fgf8) RNA is decreased and Fgf4 RNA is not detected. In the ld mesenchyme, Sonic hedgehog (Shh), Evx1 and Wnt5a expression is decreased. In chimeras between ld ectoderm and wild-type mesenchyme, a ridge of normal morphology and function is restored, Fgf8 and Shh are expressed normally, Fgf4 is induced and a normal skeletal pattern arises. These results suggest that the ld mesenchyme is unable to induce the formation of a completely functional ridge. This primary defect causes a disruption of ridge function and subsequently leads to the patterning defects observed in ld limbs. We propose a model in which ridge induction requires at least two phases: an early competence phase, which includes induction of Fgf8 expression, and a later differentiation phase in which Fgf4 is induced and a morphological ridge is formed. Ld proteins appear to act during the differentiation phase.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"9169087","pmcid":null,"title":"Developmental expression of morphoregulatory genes in the mouse embryo: an analytical approach using a novel technology.","authors":["Craig JC","Eberwine JH","Calvin JA","Wlodarczyk B","Bennett GD","Finnell RH"],"grantIds":["DE 11303","ES 07165"],"grantAgencies":["NIDCR NIH HHS","NIEHS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Biochemical and molecular medicine","journalShort":"Biochem.

However, the analysis of their concurrent behavior during murine embryogenesis has been problematic. Studies involving the investigation of temporal and spatial gene expression during embryogenesis have focused solely on the analysis of isolated, single gene events. Such an approach has failed to provide an integrative picture of genetic control over the varied and complicated cellular processes governing embryogenesis. In order to interpret the enormous amount of gene expression data generated by these procedures, we have attempted to develop an analytical framework by employing the statistical concepts of principal components analysis (PCA). For the current study, we performed IST/aRNA on neural tubes dissected from the highly inbred LM/Bc murine strain collected during four gestational time periods. A subset of these genes, representing a partial signaling pathway in the developing neuroepithelium, was then subjected to PCA. Here, we report that PCA highlighted the transcriptional interplay among the genes p53, wee-1, Tgf beta-2, and bcl-2 such that the combined reciprocal regulation of their gene products is suggestive of a predominant proliferative state for the developing neuroepithelium. The application of PCA to the gene expression data has elucidated previously unknown interrelationships among cell cycle genes, growth, and transcription factors on a transcriptional level during critical stages of neurulation.

Floor-plate-inducing ability is retained when cytoplasmic Gli1 proteins are forced into the nucleus or are fused to the VP16 transactivating domain.

In this study, we analyzed the phenotype of Wnt-3a mutant embryos at early somite stages (8.0 days post coitum), when somite formation is initiated. In Wnt-3a mutants, cells which have ingressed through the primitive streak do not migrate laterally but remain under the streak and form an ectopic tubular structure. Several neural-specific molecular markers, but no paraxial mesoderm markers, are expressed in this structure, suggesting that the ectopic tube is an additional neural tube. In normal embryos, Wnt-3a is expressed in the primitive ectoderm, including the cells which are fated to give rise to the paraxial mesoderm and neurectoderm, but expression is absent in migrating mesoderm cells.

As a consequence, the tissue architecture of the stomach and small intestine was distorted, with abnormal crypt structure, formation of mucin filled cysts, and lengthening of villi. Changes in the cellular phenotype and composition of the gastric and intestinal epithelia also suggests that epithelial cell-lineage allocation or differentiation may be affected by loss of Fkh6.

We studied the expression of transcription factors in neural plate explants to identify tissues, and the molecules produced by these tissues, that regulate medial-lateral and local patterning of the prosencephalic neural plate. Molecular properties of the medial neural plate are regulated by the prechordal plate perhaps through the action of Sonic Hedgehog. By contrast, gene expression in the lateral neural plate is regulated by non-neural ectoderm and bone morphogenetic proteins. This suggests that the forebrain employs the same medial-lateral (ventral-dorsal) patterning mechanisms present in the rest of the central nervous system. We have also found that the anterior neural ridge regulates patterning of the anterior neural plate, perhaps through a mechanism that is distinct from those that regulate general medial-lateral patterning. The anterior neural ridge is essential for expression of BF1, a gene encoding a transcription factor required for regionalization and growth of the telencephalic and optic vesicles. In addition, the anterior neural ridge expresses Fgf8, and recombinant FGF8 protein is capable of inducing BF1, suggesting that FGF8 regulates the development of anterolateral neural plate derivatives. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the neural plate is subdivided into distinct anterior-posterior domains that have different responses to the inductive signals from the prechordal plate, Sonic Hedgehog, the anterior neural ridge and FGF8. In sum, these results suggest that regionalization of the forebrain primordia is established by several distinct patterning mechanisms: (1) anterior-posterior patterning creates transverse zones with differential competence within the neural plate, (2) patterning along the medial-lateral axis generates longitudinally aligned domains and (3) local inductive interactions, such as a signal(s) from the anterior neural ridge, further define the regional organization.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"9158147","pmcid":null,"title":"Sequence analysis, identification of evolutionary conserved motifs and expression analysis of murine tcof1 provide further evidence for a potential function for the gene and its human homologue, TCOF1.","authors":["Dixon J","Hovanes K","Shiang R","Dixon MJ"],"grantIds":["AR-42377-03"],"grantAgencies":["NIAMS NIH HHS","Wellcome Trust"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Human molecular genetics","journalShort":"Hum.

In the current study, the murine homologue of the Treacher Collins syndrome gene has been isolated and shown to encode a low complexity, serine/alanine-rich protein of 133 kDa.

Recently, fibroblast growth factor-4 has been identified as a crucial determinant of AER function, which directs limb bud outgrowth, and Sonic hedgehog has been identified as a signaling molecule that mediates ZPA function, which specifies anterior-posterior patterning in the developing limb bud. In addition, Shh and FGF-4 reciprocally reinforce each other's expression via a positive feedback loop, providing a molecular basis for the coordination of limb bud outgrowth and anterior-posterior patterning. The mechanisms by which these signaling centers come to occupy their normal positions in the posterior limb bud during development are not understood. Here we identify and characterize Alx-4, a gene that encodes a paired-type homeodomain protein. Alx-4 is expressed in several populations of mesenchymal cells, including mesenchymal cells in the anterior limb bud, and mice homozygous for targeted disruption of the Alx-4 gene have multiple abnormalities, including preaxial polydactyly. The polydactyly is associated with the formation of an ectopic anterior ZPA, as indicated by anterior expression of Sonic hedgehog, HoxD13 and fibroblast growth factor-4. The expression of other candidate regulators of anterior-posterior positional information in the limb bud, including HoxB8 and Gli3, is not altered in Alx-4 mutant embryos. By chromosomal mapping experiments, Alx-4 is tightly linked to Strong's luxoid, a polydactylous mouse mutant.

Previous data suggest that Otx1 and Otx2, two murine homologs of the Drosophila orthodenticle (otd) gene, might both contribute to brain morphogenesis. To gain insight into this possibility, the level of OTX proteins was modified by altering in vivo the Otx gene dosage. Here we report that Otx genes may cooperate in brain morphogenesis and that a minimal level of OTX proteins, corresponding either to one copy each of Otx1 and Otx2, or to only two copies of Otx2, is required for proper regionalization and subsequent patterning of the developing brain. Thus, as revealed by anatomical and molecular analyses, only Otx1-/-; Otx2+/- embryos lacked mesencephalon, pretectal area, dorsal thalamus and showed an heavy reduction of the Ammon's horn, while the metencephalon was dramatically enlarged occupying the mesencencephalic area. In 8.5 days post coitum (d.p.c.) Otx1-/-; Otx2+/- embryos, the expression patterns of mesencephalic-metencephalic (mes-met) markers such as En-1 and Wnt-1 confirmed the early presence of the area fated to give rise to mesencephalon and metencephalon while Fgf-8 transcripts were improperly localized in a broader domain. Thus, in Otx1-/-; Otx2+/- embryos, Fgf-8 misexpression is likely to be the consequence of a reduced level of specification between mes-met primitive neuroepithelia that triggers the following repatterning involving the transformation of mesencephalon into metencephalon, the establishment of an isthmic-like structure in the caudal diencephalon and, by 12.5 d.p.c., the telencephalic expression of Wnt-1 and En-2. Taken together these findings support the existence of a molecular mechanism depending on a precise threshold of OTX proteins that is required to specify early regional diversity between adjacent mes-met territories and, in turn, to allow the correct positioning of the isthmic organizer.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"9375918","pmcid":null,"title":"Limb, genital, CNS, and facial malformations result from gene/environment-induced cholesterol deficiency: further evidence for a link to sonic hedgehog.","authors":["Lanoue L","Dehart DB","Hinsdale ME","Maeda N","Tint GS","Sulik KK"],"grantIds":["AA08204","HD28845","RR00111"],"grantAgencies":["NIAAA NIH HHS","NICHD NIH HHS","NCRR NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"American journal of medical genetics","journalShort":"Am.

The Shh gene is expressed throughout the embryonic gut endoderm with the exception of the pancreatic bud endoderm, which instead expresses high levels of the homeodomain protein Ipf1/Pdx1 (insulin promoter factor 1/pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1), an essential regulator of early pancreatic development. Here, we have examined whether the differential expression of Shh in the embryonic gut tube controls the differentiation of the surrounding mesoderm into specialised mesoderm derivatives of the small intestine and pancreas. To test this, we used the promoter of the Ipf1/Pdx1 gene to selectively express Shh in the developing pancreatic epithelium. In Ipf1/Pdx1-Shh transgenic mice, the pancreatic mesoderm developed into smooth muscle and interstitial cells of Cajal, characteristic of the intestine, rather than into pancreatic mesenchyme and spleen. Also, pancreatic explants exposed to Shh underwent a similar program of intestinal differentiation.

One such factor is Wnt-7a, a member of the Wnt family of secreted proteins, which is expressed in the dorsal ectoderm. Loss of Wnt-7a results in the appearance of ventral characteristics in the dorsal half of the distal limb. Conversely, En-1, a homeodomain transcription factor, is expressed exclusively in the ventral ectoderm, where it represses Wnt-7a. En-1 mutants have dorsal characteristics in the ventral half of the distal limb. Experiments in the chick suggest that the dorsalizing activity of Wnt-7a in the mesenchyme is mediated through the regulation of the LIM-homeodomain transcription factor Lmx-1. Here we have examined the relationship between Wnt-7a, En-1 and Lmx-1b, a mouse homolog of chick Lmx-1, in patterning the mammalian limb. We find that Wnt-7a is required for Lmx-1b expression in distal limb mesenchyme, and that Lmx-1b activation in the ventral mesenchyme of En-1 mutants requires Wnt-7a. Consistent with Lmx-1b playing a primary role in dorsalization of the limb, we find a direct correlation between regions of the anterior distal limb in which Lmx-lb is misregulated during limb development and the localization of dorsal-ventral patterning defects in Wnt-7a and En-1 mutant adults. Thus, ectopic Wnt-7a expression and Lmx-1b activation underlie the dorsalized En-1 phenotype, although our analysis also reveals a Wnt-7a-independent activity for En-1 in the repression of pigmentation in the ventral epidermis. Finally, we demonstrate that ectopic expression of Wnt-7a in the ventral limb ectoderm of En-1 mutants results in the formation of a second, ventral apical ectodermal ridge (AER) at the junction between Wnt-7a-expressing and nonexpressing ectoderm. Unlike the normal AER, ectopic AER formation is dependent upon Wnt-7a activity, indicating that distinct genetic mechanisms may be involved in primary and secondary AER formation.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"9342041","pmcid":null,"title":"The mouse Ulnaless mutation deregulates posterior HoxD gene expression and alters appendicular patterning.","authors":["Peichel CL","Prabhakaran B","Vogt TF"],"grantIds":["HD-30707"],"grantAgencies":["NICHD NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":3,"month":9,"year":1997,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Body Patterning","Extremities","Female","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Gene Targeting","Genes, Homeobox","Genitalia, Female","Genitalia, Male","Homeodomain Proteins","Limb Buds","Limb Deformities, Congenital","Male","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Multigene Family","Mutation","Phenotype","Ulna"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"The semi-dominant mouse mutation Ulnaless alters patterning of the appendicular but not the axial skeleton.

The Ulnaless digit phenotypes are attributed to a reduction in the distal expression of Hoxd-13, Hoxd-12, Hoxd-11 and Hoxa-13.

The neural crest origin of tooth mesenchyme has been confirmed and recent evidence suggests that specific combinations of homeobox genes expressed in the neural crest cells may regulate the types of teeth and their patterning. Signalling molecules in the Shh, FGF, BMP and Wnt families appear to regulate the early steps of tooth morphogenesis and some transcription factors associated with these pathways have been shown to be necessary for tooth development.

We found no significant differences in the numbers of apoptotic cells or in cell proliferation in the mesoderm of alpha5-null embryos compared to wild-type controls.

These results suggest that alpha5beta1-fibronectin interactions are not essential for the initial commitment of mesodermal cells, but are crucial for maintenance of mesodermal derivatives during postgastrulation stages and also for the survival of some neural crest cells.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"9428417","pmcid":null,"title":"Role of Dlx-1 and Dlx-2 genes in patterning of the murine dentition.","authors":["Thomas BL","Tucker AS","Qui M","Ferguson CA","Hardcastle Z","Rubenstein JL","Sharpe PT"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":2,"month":12,"year":1997,"meshHeadings":["Animals","DNA-Binding Proteins","Epithelium","Female","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","High Mobility Group Proteins","Homeodomain Proteins","Male","Maxilla","Mesoderm","Mice","Mice, Mutant Strains","Molar","Mutation","Odontogenesis","Recombination, Genetic","SOX9 Transcription Factor","Tooth","Transcription Factors"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"The molecular events of odontogenic induction are beginning to be elucidated, but until now nothing was known about the molecular basis of the patterning of the dentition. A role for Dlx-1 and Dlx-2 genes in patterning of the dentition has been proposed with the genes envisaged as participating in an 'odontogenic homeobox gene code' by specifying molar development. This proposal was based on the restricted expression of the genes in molar ectomesenchyme derived from cranial neural crest cells prior to tooth initiation. Mice with targeted null mutations of both Dlx-1 and Dlx-2 homeobox genes do not develop maxillary molar teeth but incisors and mandibular molars are normal. We have carried out heterologous recombinations between mutant and wild-type maxillary epithelium and mesenchyme and show that the ectomesenchyme underlying the maxillary molar epithelium has lost its odontogenic potential. Using molecular markers of branchial arch neural crest (Barx1) and commitment to chondrogenic differentiation (Sox9), we show that this population alters its fate from odontogenic to become chondrogenic. These results provide evidence that a subpopulation of cranial neural crest is specified as odontogenic by Dlx-1 and Dlx-2 genes. Loss of function of these genes results in reprogramming of this population of ectomesenchyme cells into chondrocytes. This is the first indication that the development of different shaped teeth at different positions in the jaws is determined by independent genetic pathways.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"9435295","pmcid":null,"title":"Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2)-mediated reciprocal regulation loop between FGF8 and FGF10 is essential for limb induction.","authors":["Xu X","Weinstein M","Li C","Naski M","Cohen RI","Ornitz DM","Leder P","Deng C"],"grantIds":["CA60673"],"grantAgencies":["NCI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":2,"month":2,"year":1998,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Base Sequence","DNA Primers","Ear, Inner","Embryonic Induction","Extremities","Female","Fibroblast Growth Factor 10","Fibroblast Growth Factor 8","Fibroblast Growth Factors","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Growth Substances","Male","Mice","Mice, Knockout","Mutation","Phenotype","Placentation","Polymerase Chain Reaction","Pregnancy","Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases","Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2","Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor","Sequence Deletion","Signal Transduction"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"FGFR2 is a membrane-spanning tyrosine kinase that serves as a high affinity receptor for several members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family.

We showed that murine FGFR2 is essential for chorioallantoic fusion and placenta trophoblast cell proliferation. Fgfr2(DeltaIgIII/DeltaIgIII) embryos displayed two distinct defects that resulted in failures in formation of a functional placenta.

We have analysed limb development in this mutant with respect to morphogenesis, gene expression patterns and ectopic polarising activity. The results reveal a gain-of-function mutation at a locus that mediates pattern formation in the developing limb. Shh expression is identical with that of wild-type embryos, i.e. there is no ectopic expression. However, mesenchyme from the anterior aspects of Dbf/+ mutant limb buds, when transplanted to the anterior side of chick wing buds, induces duplication of the distal skeletal elements. Mid-distal mesenchymal transplants from early, but not later, Dbf/+ limb buds are also able to induce duplication. This demonstration of polarising activity in the absence of Shh expression identifies the gene at the Dbf locus as a new genetic component of the Shh signalling pathway, which (at least in its mutated form) is able to activate signal transduction independently of Shh. The mutant gene product is sufficient to fulfil the signalling properties of Shh including upregulation of the direct Shh target genes Ptc and Gli, and induction of the downstream target genes Bmp2, Fgf4 and Hoxd13. The expression domains of all these genes extend from their normal posterior domains into the anterior part of the limb bud without being focused on a discrete ectopic site. These observations dissociate polarising activity from Shh gene expression in the Dbf/+ limb bud. We suggest that the product of the normal Dbf gene is a key active constituent of the polarising region, possibly acting in the extracellular compartment.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"9409670","pmcid":null,"title":"Hoxd-12 differentially affects preaxial and postaxial chondrogenic branches in the limb and regulates Sonic hedgehog in a positive feedback loop.","authors":["Knezevic V","De Santo R","Schughart K","Huffstadt U","Chiang C","Mahon KA","Mackem S"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":22,"month":11,"year":1997,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Base Sequence","Bone and Bones","Cartilage","DNA","Extremities","Feedback","Female","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Genes, Homeobox","Hedgehog Proteins","Homeodomain Proteins","Limb Deformities, Congenital","Male","Mice","Mice, Transgenic","Molecular Sequence Data","Phenotype","Promoter Regions, Genetic","Proteins","Trans-Activators","Transcription Factors","Transcriptional Activation"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Several 5' members of the Hoxd cluster are expressed in nested posterior-distal domains of the limb bud suggesting a role in regulating anteroposterior pattern of skeletal elements. While loss-of-function mutants have demonstrated a regulatory role for these genes in the developing limb, extensive functional overlaps between various different Hox genes has hampered elucidation of the roles played by individual members. In particular, the function of Hoxd-12 in the limb remains obscure. Using a gain-of-function approach, we find that Hoxd-12 misexpression in transgenic mice produces apparent transformations of anterior digits to posterior morphology and digit duplications, while associated tibial hemimelia and other changes indicate that formation/growth of certain skeletal elements is selectively inhibited. If the digital arch represents an anterior bending of the main limb axis, then the results are all reconcilable with a model in which Hoxd-12 promotes formation of postaxial chondrogenic condensations branching from this main axis (including the anteriormost digit) and selectively antagonizes formation of 'true' preaxial condensations that branch from this main axis (such as the tibia). Hoxd-12 misexpression can also induce ectopic Sonic hedgehog (Shh) expression, resulting in mirror-image polydactyly in the limb. Misexpression of Hoxd-12 in other lateral plate derivatives (sternum, pelvis) likewise phenocopies several luxoid/luxate class mouse mutants that all share ectopic Shh signalling. This suggests that feedback activation of Shh expression may be a major function of Hoxd-12. Hoxd-12 can bind to and transactivate the Shh promoter in vitro. Furthermore, expression of either exogenous Hoxd-11 or Hoxd-12 in cultured limb bud cells, together with FGF, induces expression of the endogenous Shh gene. Together these results suggest that certain 5' Hoxd genes directly amplify the posterior Shh polarizing signal in a reinforcing positive feedback loop during limb bud outgrowth.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"9462734","pmcid":null,"title":"Ptch2, a second mouse Patched gene is co-expressed with Sonic hedgehog.","authors":["Motoyama J","Takabatake T","Takeshima K","Hui C"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Nature genetics","journalShort":"Nat.

The temporal and spatial pattern of gene expression suggests that Fgf10 plays a role in directional outgrowth and possibly induction of epithelial buds, and that positive and negative regulators of Fgf10 are produced by the endoderm. In transgenic lungs overexpressing Shh in the endoderm, Fgf10 transcription is reduced, suggesting that high levels of SHH downregulate Fgf10. Addition of FGF10 to embryonic day 11.5 lung tissue (endoderm plus mesenchyme) in Matrigel or collagen gel culture elicits a cyst-like expansion of the endoderm after 24 hours. In Matrigel, but not collagen, this is followed by extensive budding after 48-60 hours. This response involves an increase in the rate of endodermal cell proliferation. The activity of FGF1, FGF7 and FGF10 was also tested directly on isolated endoderm in Matrigel culture. Under these conditions, FGF1 elicits immediate endodermal budding, while FGF7 and FGF10 initially induce expansion of the endoderm. However, within 24 hours, samples treated with FGF10 give rise to multiple buds, while FGF7-treated endoderm never progresses to bud formation, at all concentrations of factor tested. Although exogenous FGF1, FGF7 and FGF10 have overlapping activities in vitro, their in vivo expression patterns are quite distinct in relation to early branching events.

We have recovered a spontaneous mouse mutation causing left/right patterning defects together with defects in anteroposterior and dorsoventral patterning. This mutation is recessive lethal and was named no turning (nt) because the mutant embryos fail to undergo embryonic turning. nt embryos exhibit cranial neural tube closure defects and malformed somites and are caudally truncated. Development of the heart arrests at the looped heart tube stage, with cardiovascular defects indicated by ballooning of the pericardial sac and the pooling of blood in various regions of the embryo. Interestingly, in nt embryos, the direction of heart looping was randomized. Nodal and lefty, two genes that are normally expressed only in the left lateral plate mesoderm, show expression in the right and left lateral plate mesoderm. Lefty, which is normally also expressed in the floorplate, is not found in the prospective floor plate of nt embryos. This suggests the possibility of notochordal defects. This was confirmed by histological analysis and the examination of sonic hedgehog, Brachyury, and HNF-3 beta gene expression. These studies showed that the notochord is present in the early nt embryo, but degenerates as development progresses. Overall, these findings support the hypothesis that the notochord plays an active role in left/right patterning.

In contrast, Lp/Lp embryos exhibit a broad region of flat neural plate in the midline, displacing the sites of neuroepithelial bending to more lateral positions.

Nkx-3.1 is dynamically expressed during somitogenesis only in the youngest, most newly-formed somites at the caudal end of the embryo. We found that the expression of Nkx-3.1 in pre-somitic tissue explants is induced by the notochord and maintained in newly-differentiated somites by the notochord and both ventral and dorsal parts of the neural tube.

Shh could induce and maintain Nkx-3.1 expression in pre-somitic mesoderm and young somites but not in more mature, differentiated ones.

Premature fusion of cranial sutures, known as craniosynostosis, presumably involves disturbance of these interactions. Mutations in the homeobox gene Msx2 as well as the FGF receptors cause human craniosynostosis syndromes. Our histological analysis of mouse calvarial development demonstrated morphological differences in the sagittal suture between embryonic and postnatal stages. In vitro culture of mouse calvaria showed that embryonic, but not postnatal, dura mater regulated suture patency. We next analysed by in situ hybridisation the expression of several genes, which are known to act in conserved signalling pathways, in the sagittal suture during embryonic (E15-E18) and postnatal stages (P1-P6). Msx1 and Msx2 were expressed in the sutural mesenchyme and the dura mater. FGFR2(BEK), as well as Bmp2 and Bmp4, were intensely expressed in the osteogenic fronts and Bmp4 also in the mesenchyme of the sagittal suture and in the dura mater. Fgf9 was expressed throughout the calvarial mesenchyme, the dura mater, the developing bones and the overlying skin, but Fgf4 was not detected in these tissues. Interestingly, Shh and Ptc started to be expressed in patched pattern along the osteogenic fronts at the end of embryonic development and, at this time, the expression of Bmp4 and sequentially those of Msx2 and Bmp2 were reduced, and they also acquired patched expression patterns. The expression of Msx2 in the dura mater disappeared after birth. <P> FGF and BMP signalling pathways were further examined in vitro, in E15 mouse calvarial explants. Interestingly, beads soaked in FGF4 accelerated sutural closure when placed on the osteogenic fronts, but had no such effect when placed on the mid-sutural mesenchyme. BMP4 beads caused an increase in tissue volume both when placed on the osteogenic fronts and on the mid-sutural area, but did not effect suture closure. BMP4 induced the expression of both Msx1 and Msx2 genes in sutural tissue, while FGF4 induced only Msx1. We suggest that the local application of FGF on the osteogenic fronts accelerating suture closure in vitro, mimics the pathogenesis of human craniosynostosis syndromes in which mutations in the FGF receptor genes apparently cause constitutive activation of the receptors. Taken together, our data suggest that conserved signalling pathways regulate tissue interactions during suture morphogenesis and intramembranous bone formation of the calvaria and that morphogenesis of mouse sagittal suture is controlled by different molecular mechanisms during the embryonic and postnatal stages. Signals from the dura mater may regulate the maintenance of sutural patency prenatally, whereas signals in the osteogenic fronts dominate after birth.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"9585504","pmcid":null,"title":"Noggin-mediated antagonism of BMP signaling is required for growth and patterning of the neural tube and somite.","authors":["McMahon JA","Takada S","Zimmerman LB","Fan CM","Harland RM","McMahon AP"],"grantIds":["GM49346"],"grantAgencies":["NIGMS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Genes & development","journalShort":"Genes Dev.","day":15,"month":5,"year":1998,"meshHeadings":["1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine","Animals","B-Cell-Specific Activator Protein","Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2","Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4","Bone Morphogenetic Proteins","Carrier Proteins","Central Nervous System","Colforsin","Cyclic AMP","Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases","DNA-Binding Proteins","Embryonic and Fetal Development","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Hedgehog Proteins","Hindlimb","In Situ Hybridization","Mesoderm","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Mice, Inbred Strains","Molecular Sequence Data","Morphogenesis","Nuclear Proteins","Organ Culture Techniques","Paired Box Transcription Factors","Proteins","Recombinant Proteins","Somites","Spinal Cord","Trans-Activators","Transcription Factors","Transforming Growth Factor beta"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Embryonic patterning in vertebrates is dependent upon the balance of inductive signals and their specific antagonists.

However, Noggin is required for subsequent growth and patterning of the neural tube. Early BMP-dependent dorsal cell fates, the roof plate and neural crest, form in the absence of Noggin. However, there is a progressive loss of early, Sonic hedgehog (Shh)-dependent ventral cell fates despite the normal expression of Shh in the notochord.

In the first phase, the BMP4 signal from the ventral diencephalon, expressing BMP4, Wnt5a, and FGF8, represents a critical dorsal neuroepithelial signal for pituitary organ commitment in vivo. Subsequently, a BMP2 signal emanates from a ventral pituitary organizing center that forms at the boundary of a region of oral ectoderm in which Shh expression is selectively excluded. This BMP2 signal together with a dorsal FGF8 signal, appears to create opposing activity gradients that are suggested to generate overlapping patterns of specific transcription factors underlying cell lineage specification events, whereas Wnt4 is needed for the expansion of ventral pituitary cell phenotypes. In the third phase, temporally specific loss of the BMP2 signal is required to allow terminal differentiation. The consequence of these sequential organ and cellular determination events is that each of the hormone-producing pituitary cell types-gonadotropes, thyrotropes, somatotropes, lactotropes, corticotropes, and melanotropes-appear to be determined, in a ventral-to-dorsal gradient, respectively.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"9655799","pmcid":null,"title":"Gli2 is required for induction of floor plate and adjacent cells, but not most ventral neurons in the mouse central nervous system.","authors":["Matise MP","Epstein DJ","Park HL","Platt KA","Joyner AL"],"grantIds":["R01HD35768"],"grantAgencies":["NICHD NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":31,"month":8,"year":1998,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Body Patterning","Cell Differentiation","Central Nervous System","Cranial Nerves","Dopamine","Embryonic Induction","Homozygote","Interneurons","Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors","Mice","Mice, Mutant Strains","Motor Neurons","Notochord","Oncogene Proteins","Serotonin","Spinal Cord","Trans-Activators","Transcription Factors","Zinc Fingers"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Induction of the floor plate at the ventral midline of the neural tube is one of the earliest events in the establishment of dorsoventral (d/v) polarity in the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS).

In vertebrates, several downstream components of this signalling pathway have been identified, including members of the Gli transcription factor family. In this study, we have examined d/v patterning of the CNS in Gli2 mouse mutants. We have found that the floor plate throughout the midbrain, hindbrain and spinal cord does not form in Gli2 homozygotes. Despite this, motoneurons and ventral interneurons form in their normal d/v positions at 9.5 to 12.5 days postcoitum (dpc).

We show that activin betaA is expressed in presumptive tooth-germ mesenchyme and is thus a candidate for a signaling molecule in tooth development. Analysis of tooth development in activin betaA mutant embryos shows that incisor and mandibular molar teeth fail to develop beyond the bud stage. Activin betaA is thus an essential component of tooth development. Development of maxillary molars, however, is unaffected in the mutants. Using tissue recombination experiments we show that activin is required in the mesenchyme prior to bud formation and that although activin signaling from mesenchyme to epithelium takes place, mutant epithelium retains its ability to support tooth development. Implantation of beads soaked in activin A, into developing mandibles, is able to completely rescue tooth development from E11.5, but not E12.5 or E13.5, confirming that activin is an early, essential mesenchyme signal required before tooth bud formation. Normal development of maxillary molars in the absence of activin shows a position specific role for this pathway in development of dentition. Functional redundancy with activin B or other TGFbeta family members that bind to activin receptors cannot explain development of maxillary molars in the mutants since the activin-signaling pathway appears not to be active in these tooth germs. The early requirement for activin signaling in the mesenchyme in incisor and mandibular molar tooth germs must be carried-out in maxillary molar mesenchyme by other independent signaling pathways.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"9731531","pmcid":null,"title":"Essential function of Gli2 and Gli3 in the formation of lung, trachea and oesophagus.","authors":["Motoyama J","Liu J","Mo R","Ding Q","Post M","Hui CC"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Nature genetics","journalShort":"Nat.

For example, epithelially expressed Bmp4 induces Msx1 and Lef1 as well as itself in the underlying mesenchyme. In this paper we have investigated the role of four epithelial signaling molecules, Bmp2, Shh, Wnt10a, and Wnt10b, in the early inductive cascades that govern tooth development. We show that all four genes are specifically expressed in the epithelium between E11.0 and E12.0 when tooth morphogenesis is first apparent. Although Shh, Bmp2, and Wnt10b have similar, if not identical, expression patterns, each signal has a distinct molecular action on the jaw mesenchyme. Whereas Shh and Wnt10b can induce general Hedgehog and Wnt targets, Ptc and Gli for Shh and Lef1 for Wnt10b, only Bmp2 is able to induce tooth-specific expression of Msx1. Thus, there are distinct targets for all three pathways. Interestingly, both Bmp and Wnt signaling activate Lef1, making it a candidate for integrating the two distinct signaling pathways.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"9739117","pmcid":null,"title":"Alteration of limb and brain patterning in early mouse embryos by ultrasound-guided injection of Shh-expressing cells.","authors":["Liu A","Joyner AL","Turnbull DH"],"grantIds":["R01HD35768","R01NS35876"],"grantAgencies":["NICHD NIH HHS","NINDS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Mechanisms of development","journalShort":"Mech.

One of the vertebrate Hh family members, Shh, has been shown to be able to mediate the function of the ZPA. Several naturally occurring mouse mutations with the phenotype of preaxial polydactyly exhibit ectopic Shh expression at the anterior limb margin. In this study, we report the molecular characterization of a spontaneous mouse mutation, Doublefoot (Dbf). Dbf is a dominant mutation which maps to chromosome 1. Heterozygous and homozygous embryos display a severe polydactyly with 6 to 8 digits on each limb. We show here that Shh is expressed normally in Dbf mutants. In contrast, a second Hh family member, Indian hedgehog (Ihh) which maps close to Dbf, is ectopically expressed in the distal limb bud. Ectopic Ihh expression in the distal and anterior limb bud results in the ectopic activation of several genes associated with anterior-posterior and proximal-distal patterning (Fgf4, Hoxd13, Bmp2). In addition, specific components in the Hedgehog pathway are either ectopically activated (Ptc, Ptc-2, Gli1) or repressed (Gli2). We propose that misexpression of Ihh, and not a novel Smoothened ligand as recently suggested (Hayes et al., 1998), is responsible for the Dbf phenotype. We consider that Ihh has a similar activity to Shh when expressed in the early Shh-responsive limb bud. To determine whether Dbf maps to the Ihh locus, which is also on chromosome 1, we performed an interspecific backcross. These results demonstrate that Dbf and Ihh are genetically separated by approximately 1.3 centimorgans, suggesting that Dbf mutation may cause an exceptionally long-range disruption of Ihh regulation. Although this leads to ectopic activation of Ihh, normal expression of Ihh in the cartilaginous elements is retained.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"9739106","pmcid":null,"title":"Genetic rescue of segmentation defect in MesP2-deficient mice by MesP1 gene replacement.","authors":["Saga Y"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Mechanisms of development","journalShort":"Mech.

The introduced Mesp1 cDNA could rescue the defects caused by Mesp2 deficiency in a dosage-dependent manner.

The presence of the AER is required for the continued outgrowth of the limb bud. Classical embryological studies have led to the hypothesis that a secreted mesenchymal factor is required to maintain the AER. We have undertaken a detailed analysis of Dactylaplasia (Dac) mice, a semidominant mutant which displays missing central digits in the fore- and hindlimbs of heterozygous animals and monodactyly in homozygous animals. Our data show that Dac mice have a defect in the maintenance of the AER. At E10.5, the mutant AER is found to be morphologically normal. However, by E11.5 the central aspect of the AER degenerates leaving the anterior and posterior AER intact. In homozygous mice both the central and anterior AER degenerate, while the posterior extremity of the AER is unaffected. Analysis of BrdU incorporation reveals that degeneration of the AER is due to a lack of cell proliferation in the mutant AER. The loss of the AER leads to a reduction in cell proliferation in the subridge mesenchyme at E11.5. The data represent direct genetic evidence for the existence of an AER maintenance activity that is distinct from AER induction and differentiation. Moreover, the data suggest that the role of the AER maintenance factor is to promote cell proliferation in the ridge.

Here we show that correct localization of both head- and trunk-organizing centres requires Cripto, a putative signalling molecule that is a member of the EGF-CFC gene family. Before gastrulation, Cripto is asymmetrically expressed in a proximal-distal gradient in the epiblast, and subsequently is expressed in the primitive streak and newly formed embryonic mesoderm.

The genes analyzed were Shh, HNF3alpha, HNF3beta, Brachyury, Hoxb1, Evx1, Fgf8, Wnt5a and Wnt5b. No differences could be detected between non-mutant embryos and ct/ct embryos with normal PNP size for any of these genes.

Analysis of younger embryos revealed that prior to the stage at which embryos at risk of developing neural tube defects can be detected, the same proportion of ct/ct embryos shows reduced Wnt5a expression. The proportion of embryos showing reduced expression and almost undetectable expression of Wnt5a reflects the proportions of tail defects and spina bifida seen at later stages. We suggest that deficiency of Wnt5a signaling in the ventral caudal region tissues is an important component of the mechanism of development of the defects in affected curly tail mutant mice, and that it is causally related to decreased cell proliferation within the ventral caudal region.

They consist of misfolded ectodermal and endodermal cell layers, do not form a primitive streak or any detectable mesodermal cells and fail to express the developmental marker genes Bra (T), Bmp-2/4 and Shh. Activation of the SRF-regulated immediate early genes Egr-1 and c-fos, as well as the alpha-Actin gene, is severely impaired. Our study identifies SRF as a new and essential regulator of mammalian mesoderm formation. We therefore suggest that in mammals Ras/MAPK signalling contributes to mesoderm induction, as is the case in amphibia.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"9811851","pmcid":null,"title":"Characterization of two patched receptors for the vertebrate hedgehog protein family.","authors":["Carpenter D","Stone DM","Brush J","Ryan A","Armanini M","Frantz G","Rosenthal A","de Sauvage FJ"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","journalShort":"Proc.

Current models suggest that binding of Shh to PTCH prevents the normal inhibition of the seven-transmembrane-protein Smoothened (SMO) by PTCH. According to this model, the inhibition of SMO signaling is relieved after mutational inactivation of PTCH in the basal cell nevus syndrome. Recently, PTCH2, a molecule with sequence homology to PTCH, has been identified. To characterize both PTCH molecules with respect to the various Hedgehog proteins, we have isolated the human PTCH2 gene. Biochemical analysis of PTCH and PTCH2 shows that they both bind to all hedgehog family members with similar affinity and that they can form a complex with SMO. However, the expression patterns of PTCH and PTCH2 do not fully overlap. While PTCH is expressed throughout the mouse embryo, PTCH2 is found at high levels in the skin and in spermatocytes. Because Desert Hedgehog (Dhh) is expressed specifically in the testis and is required for germ cell development, it is likely that PTCH2 mediates its activity in vivo. Chromosomal localization of PTCH2 places it on chromosome 1p33-34, a region deleted in some germ cell tumors, raising the possibility that PTCH2 may be a tumor suppressor in Dhh target cells.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"9808779","pmcid":null,"title":"Apoptosis of epaxial myotome in Danforth's short-tail (Sd) mice in somites that form following notochord degeneration.","authors":["Asakura A","Tapscott SJ"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Developmental biology","journalShort":"Dev.

The comparisons of gene expression patterns and morphologies suggest that similar molecular cascades are used in the early budding of tooth germs, in the initiation of tooth crown base formation, and in the initiation of each cusp's development. Furthermore, the co-localization of several genes indicate that epithelial signalling centres function at the three stages of morphogenesis. The earliest signalling centre in the early budding epithelium has not been reported before, but the latter signalling centres, the primary and the secondary enamel knots, have been studied in mouse.

We have specifically examined the role of Hoxa-10 in development of the male accessory sex organs by characterizing expression of Hoxa-10 in the developing male reproductive tract and correlating expression to morphologic abnormalities in knockout mice deficient for Hoxa-10 function. We report that Hoxa-10 expression in the Wolffian duct and urogenital sinus is regionally restricted and temporally regulated. The domain of expression is defined anteriorly by the caudal epididymis and extends posteriorly to the prostatic anlagen of the urogenital sinus. Expression was maximal at E18 and down-regulated postnatally, well before accessory sex organ morphogenesis is completed. Expression in the prostatic anlagen of the urogenital sinus cultured in vitro does not depend upon the presence of testosterone. Loss of Hoxa-10 function is associated with diminished stromal clefting of the seminal vesicles and decreased size and branching of the coagulating gland. The ductal architecture of the coagulating gland was altered in approximately 30% of mutants examined and suggests a partial posterior morphologic transformation of the coagulating gland.

Cocaine HCl (60 mg/kg i.p.) was administered to pregnant mice on gestational days 6-8, the time that immediately precedes the appearance of shh. Control dams received i.p. saline.

The distribution of mRNA for patched (ptc), the membrane receptor for shh, was also indistinguishable between both groups.

A loss-of-function mutation of Wnt5a leads to an inability to extend the A-P axis due to a progressive reduction in the size of caudal structures.

This is consistent with the loss of Nkx2.1 expression, which defines the dorsoventral boundary within the anterior foregut in wild-type E9 embryos. Failure in septation between the trachea and the esophagus in Nkx2.1(-/-) mice leads to the formation of a common lumen that connects the pharynx to the stomach, serving both as trachea and as esophagus, similar in phenotype to a human pathologic condition termed tracheoesophageal fistula. The main-stem bronchi bifurcate from this common structure and connect to profoundly hypoplastic lungs.

In the ventral neural tube, motor neuron and interneuron generation depends on the graded activity of the signalling protein Sonic hedgehog (Shh). These neuronal subtypes derive from distinct progenitor cell populations that express the homeodomain proteins Nkx2.2 or Pax6 in response to graded Shh signalling. In mice lacking Pax6, progenitor cells generate neurons characteristic of exposure to greater Shh activity.

Here we have characterized the skin and hair phenotypes of mice carrying a null mutation in the PDGF-A gene. Postnatal PDGF-A-/- mice developed thinner dermis, misshapen hair follicles, smaller dermal papillae, abnormal dermal sheaths and thinner hair, compared with wild-type siblings. BrdU labeling showed reduced cell proliferation in the dermis and in the dermal sheaths of PDGF-A-/- skin. PDGF-A-/- skin transplantation to nude mice led to abnormal hair formation, reproducing some of the features of the skin phenotype of PDGF-A-/- mice. Taken together, expression patterns and mutant phenotypes suggest that epidermal PDGF-A has a role in stimulating the proliferation of dermal mesenchymal cells that may contribute to the formation of dermal papillae, mesenchymal sheaths and dermal fibroblasts.

Due to the complex and variable expression of these disorders, it is thought that WHS/PRDS results from a segmental aneusomy of 4p resulting in haploinsufficieny of an undefined number of genes that contribute to the phenotype. In an effort to identify genes that contribute to human development and whose absence may contribute to the phenotype associated with these syndromes, we have generated a transcript map of the 165-kb critical region and have identified a number of potential genes. One of these genes, WHSC2, which was identified with the IMAGE cDNA clone 53283, has been characterized. Sequence analysis defined an open reading frame of 1584 bp (528 amino acids), and transcript analysis detected a 2.4-kb transcript in all fetal and adult tissues tested. In parallel, the mouse homologue was isolated and characterized. Mouse sequence analysis and the pattern of expression are consistent with the clone being the murine equivalent of the human WHSC2 gene (designated Whsc2h). The data from sequence and transcript analysis of this new human gene in combination with the lack of significant similarity to proteins of known function imply that it represents a novel gene.

Here, we report on forebrain development in the extra toes (Xt(J)) mouse mutant which carries a null mutation of the Gli3 gene. This defect leads to a failure to establish the dorsal di-telencephalic junction and finally results in a severe size reduction of the neocortex. In addition, Xt(J)/Xt(J) mice show absence of the hippocampus (Ammon's horn plus dentate gyrus) and the choroid plexus in the lateral ventricle. The medial wall of the telencephalon, which gives rise to these structures, fails to invaginate during embryonic development. On a molecular level, disruption of dorsal telencephalon development in Xt(J)/Xt(J) embryos correlates with a loss of Emx1 and Emx2 expression. Furthermore, the expression of Fgf8 and Bmp4 in the dorsal midline of the telencephalon is altered. However, expression of Shh, which is negatively regulated by Gli3 in the spinal cord, is not affected in the Xt(J)/Xt(J) forebrain.

The gene expression patterns suggest that the odontogenic program consists of partially independent signaling cascades which define the exact location of the tooth germ, initiate epithelial budding, and transfer the odontogenic potential from the epithelium to the underlying mesenchyma. Although the diastema regions of the two species differed, in both species the earliest difference that we found was weaker expression of mesenchymal Pax9 in the diastema region than in molar and incisor regions at the dental lamina stage. However, based on earlier tissue recombination experiments it is conceivable that the developmental arrest is determined by the early oral epithelium.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"10391928","pmcid":null,"title":"Id genes are direct targets of bone morphogenetic protein induction in embryonic stem cells.","authors":["Hollnagel A","Oehlmann V","Heymer J","Rüther U","Nordheim A"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"The Journal of biological chemistry","journalShort":"J.

To obtain molecular insight into the influence of BMPs on morphogenesis, we searched for new genes directly activated by BMP signaling. In vitro cultured mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were used, cultivated in chemically defined growth medium (CDM). CDM-cultured ES cells responded very selectively to stimulation by various mesoderm inducers (BMP2/4, activin A, and basic fibroblast growth factor). BMP2/4 rapidly induced transcript levels of the homeobox genes Msx-1 and Msx-2 and the proto-oncogene JunB, whereas c-jun transcripts displayed delayed albeit prolonged increase. Using differential display cDNA cloning, six direct BMP target genes were identified. These include Id3, which showed strong mRNA induction, and the moderately induced Cyr61, DEK, and eIF4AII genes, as well as a gene encoding a GC-binding protein. Besides Id3, also the Id1 and Id2 genes were activated by BMP4 in both ES cells and a range of different cell lines. Id genes encode negative regulators of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors.

Our findings establish that Shh has an essential inductive function in the early activation of the myogenic determination genes, Myf5 and MyoD, in the epaxial somite cells that give rise to the progenitors of the deep back muscles. Shh is not required for the activation of Myf5 and MyoD at any of the other sites of myogenesis in the mouse embryo, including the hypaxial dermomyotomal cells that give rise to the abdominal and body wall muscles, or the myogenic progenitor cells that form the limb and head muscles. Shh also functions in somites to establish and maintain the medio-lateral boundaries of epaxial and hypaxial gene expression. Myf5, and not MyoD, is the target of Shh signaling in the epaxial dermomyotome, as MyoD activation by recombinant Shh protein in presomitic mesoderm explants is defective in Myf5 null embryos. In further support of the inductive function of Shh in epaxial myogenesis, we show that Shh is not essential for the survival or the proliferation of epaxial myogenic progenitors. However, Shh is required specifically for the survival of sclerotomal cells in the ventral somite as well as for the survival of ventral and dorsal neural tube cells. We conclude, therefore, that Shh has multiple functions in the somite, including inductive functions in the activation of Myf5, leading to the determination of epaxial dermomyotomal cells to myogenesis, as well as trophic functions in the maintenance of cell survival in the sclerotome and adjacent neural tube.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"10482234","pmcid":null,"title":"Requirement for the homeobox gene Hb9 in the consolidation of motor neuron identity.","authors":["Arber S","Han B","Mendelsohn M","Smith M","Jessell TM","Sockanathan S"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Neuron","journalShort":"Neuron","day":20,"month":8,"year":1999,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Axons","Cell Differentiation","Cell Movement","Chick Embryo","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Genes, Homeobox","Homeodomain Proteins","Immunohistochemistry","In Situ Hybridization","Interneurons","LIM-Homeodomain Proteins","Mice","Mice, Transgenic","Motor Neurons","Muscle, Skeletal","Nerve Tissue Proteins","Spinal Cord","Transcription Factors","Transgenes"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"The homeobox gene Hb9, like its close relative MNR2, is expressed selectively by motor neurons (MNs) in the developing vertebrate CNS.

The mammary gland is a specialized skin derivative requiring epithelial-epithelial and epithelial-stromal tissue interactions similar to those required for development of other organs, where these interactions are often controlled by hedgehog signaling. We have investigated the role of the Patched-1 (Ptc1) hedgehog receptor gene in mammary development and neoplasia. Haploinsufficiency at the Ptc1 locus results in severe histological defects in ductal structure, and minor morphological changes in terminal end buds in heterozygous postpubescent virgin animals. Defects are mainly ductal hyperplasias and dysplasias characterized by multilayered ductal walls and dissociated cells impacting ductal lumens. This phenotype is 100% penetrant. Remarkably, defects are reverted during late pregnancy and lactation but return upon involution and gland remodeling. Whole mammary gland transplants into athymic mice demonstrates that the observed dysplasias reflect an intrisic developmental defect within the gland. However, Ptc1-induced epithelial dysplasias are not stable upon transplantation into a wild-type epithelium-free fat pad, suggesting stromal (or epithelial and stromal) function of Ptc1. Mammary expression of Ptc1 mRNA is both epithelial and stromal and is developmentally regulated. Phenotypic reversion correlates with developmentally regulated and enhanced expression of Indian hedgehog (Ihh) during pregnancy and lactation.

At stage 3, the treated limb apical ectodermal ridge usually possessed no detectable abnormalities, but with continued outgrowth postaxial deficiencies became evident. Recombining control, stage matched limb bud ectoderm with treated mesoderm prior to ZPA grafting restored the duplicating activity of treated ZPA tissue. We conclude that in addition to shh an early ectoderm-dependent signal is required for the establishment of the mouse ZPA and that this factor is dependent on the posterior ectoderm.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"10521397","pmcid":null,"title":"Conserved requirement for EGF-CFC genes in vertebrate left-right axis formation.","authors":["Yan YT","Gritsman K","Ding J","Burdine RD","Corrales JD","Price SM","Talbot WS","Schier AF","Shen MM"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Genes & development","journalShort":"Genes Dev.","day":1,"month":10,"year":1999,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Axis","Body Patterning","Embryonic and Fetal Development","Epidermal Growth Factor","Gene Expression","Gene Targeting","Growth Substances","Homeodomain Proteins","Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins","Mice","Mutagenesis","Transcription Factors","Zebrafish","Zebrafish Proteins"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Specification of the left-right (L-R) axis in the vertebrate embryo requires transfer of positional information from the node to the periphery, resulting in asymmetric gene expression in the lateral plate mesoderm.

This partial ventralization of the dorsal telencephalon does not appear to be induced by an expansion of Sonic hedgehog expression in the telencephalon, but may be due to a loss of Bmp and Wnt gene expression in a putative dorsal telencephalic signaling center, the cortical hem. Our findings suggest that in dorsal telencephalon Gli3 is needed to repress ventral telencephalic identity.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"10719888","pmcid":null,"title":"Sonic hedgehog--regulated oligodendrocyte lineage genes encoding bHLH proteins in the mammalian central nervous system.","authors":["Lu QR","Yuk D","Alberta JA","Zhu Z","Pawlitzky I","Chan J","McMahon AP","Stiles CD","Rowitch DH"],"grantIds":["HD01182","HD24296"],"grantAgencies":["NICHD NIH HHS","NICHD NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Neuron","journalShort":"Neuron","day":30,"month":2,"year":2000,"meshHeadings":["Age Factors","Animals","Antigens","Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors","Biological Markers","Brain Chemistry","Cell Lineage","Cells, Cultured","Cerebral Cortex","DNA-Binding Proteins","Gene Expression","Hedgehog Proteins","Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs","Mice","Mice, Transgenic","Molecular Sequence Data","Nerve Tissue Proteins","Oligodendroglia","Proteins","Proteoglycans","RNA, Messenger","Rats","Rats, Sprague-Dawley","Sequence Homology, Amino Acid","Spinal Cord","Stem Cells","Trans-Activators"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"During development, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins regulate formation of neurons from multipotent progenitor cells.

Multiple signaling molecules are expressed in the developing tooth germ and interact each other to mediate the inductive tissue interactions. Among them are Sonic hedgehog (SHH), Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2 (BMP2) and Bone Morphogenetic Protein-4 (BMP4). We have investigated the interactions between these signaling molecules during early tooth development. We found that the expression of Shh and Bmp2 is downregulated at E12.5 and E13.5 in the dental epithelium of the Msx1 mutant tooth germ where Bmp4 expression is significantly reduced in the dental mesenchyme. Inhibition of BMP4 activity by noggin resulted in repression of Shh and Bmp2 in wild-type dental epithelium. When implanted into the dental mesenchyme of Msx1 mutants, beads soaked with BMP4 protein were able to restore the expression of both Shh and Bmp2 in the Msx1 mutant epithelium. These results demonstrated that mesenchymal BMP4 represents one component of the signal acting on the epithelium to maintain Shh and Bmp2 expression. In contrast, BMP4-soaked beads repressed Shh and Bmp2 expression in the wild-type dental epithelium. TUNEL assay indicated that this suppression of gene expression by exogenous BMP4 was not the result of an increase in programmed cell death in the tooth germ. Ectopic expression of human Bmp4 to the dental mesenchyme driven by the mouse Msx1 promoter restored Shh expression in the Msx1 mutant dental epithelium but repressed Shh in the wild-type tooth germ in vivo. We further demonstrated that this regulation of Shh expression by BMP4 is conserved in the mouse developing limb bud. In addition, Shh expression was unaffected in the developing limb buds of the transgenic mice in which a constitutively active Bmpr-IB is ectopically expressed in the forelimb posterior mesenchyme and throughout the hindlimb mesenchyme, suggesting that the repression of Shh expression by BMP4 may not be mediated by BMP receptor-IB. These results provide evidence for a new function of BMP4. BMP4 can act upstream to Shh by regulating Shh expression in mouse developing tooth germ and limb bud. Taken together, our data provide insight into a new regulatory mechanism for Shh expression, and suggest that this BMP4-mediated pathway in Shh regulation may have a general implication in vertebrate organogenesis.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"10662638","pmcid":null,"title":"Normal limb development in conditional mutants of Fgf4.","authors":["Moon AM","Boulet AM","Capecchi MR"],"grantIds":["K08 HD001373"],"grantAgencies":["NICHD NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":3,"month":3,"year":2000,"meshHeadings":["Alkaline Phosphatase","Animals","Ectoderm","Embryonic and Fetal Development","Fibroblast Growth Factor 4","Fibroblast Growth Factors","Forelimb","Genes, Lethal","Genotype","Mice","Mice, Knockout","Mice, Transgenic","Morphogenesis","Mutagenesis","Osteogenesis","Proto-Oncogene Proteins","Sequence Deletion"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) mediate multiple developmental signals in vertebrates. Several of these factors are expressed in limb bud structures that direct patterning of the limb. FGF4 is produced in the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) where it is hypothesized to provide mitogenic and morphogenic signals to the underlying mesenchyme that regulate normal limb development. Mutation of this gene in the germline of mice results in early embryonic lethality, preventing subsequent evaluation of Fgf4 function in the AER. A conditional mutant of Fgf4, based on site-specific Cre/loxP-mediated excision of the gene, allowed us to bypass embryonic lethality and directly test the role of FGF4 during limb development in living murine embryos. This conditional mutation was designed so that concomitant with inactivation of the Fgf4 gene by excision of all Fgf4-coding sequences, a reporter gene was activated in Fgf4-expressing cells, allowing assessment of the site-specific recombination reaction. Although a large body of evidence led us to predict that ablation of Fgf4 gene function in the AER of developing mice would result in abnormal limb outgrowth and patterning, we found that Fgf4 conditional mutants had normal limbs. Furthermore, expression patterns of Shh, Bmp2, Fgf8 and Fgf10 were normal in the limb buds of the conditional mutants. These findings indicate that the previously proposed FGF4-SHH feedback loop is not essential for coordination of murine limb outgrowth and patterning. We suggest that some of the roles currently attributed to FGF4 during early vertebrate limb development may be performed by other AER factors in vivo.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"10642790","pmcid":null,"title":"Cusp patterning defect in Tabby mouse teeth and its partial rescue by FGF.","authors":["Pispa J","Jung HS","Jernvall J","Kettunen P","Mustonen T","Tabata MJ","Kere J","Thesleff I"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Developmental biology","journalShort":"Dev.

Tabby first molars had an obvious defect in cusp patterning as the number of cusps was reduced and the buccal and lingual cusps were joined. The disturbance in development was first visible morphologically in the bud stage molar. The primary enamel knot in a cap stage Tabby tooth expressed all enamel knot markers analyzed but was smaller than wild type and the first pair of developing secondary enamel knots was fused. We propose that the Tabby tooth phenotype is due to growth retardation during early stages of development which leads to reduced signaling from the primary enamel knot, followed by deficient growth of the dental epithelium and lack of formation of the last developing secondary enamel knots. The ectodysplasin transcripts were expressed in the outer enamel epithelium and dental lamina. When cultured in vitro Tabby bud/cap stage molars formed fewer cusps than wild-type controls.

Together with MyoD it is essential for initiating the skeletal muscle programme in the embryo. We previously identified unexpected restricted domains of Myf5 transcription in the embryonic mouse brain, first revealed by Myf5-nlacZ(+/)(-) embryos (Tajbakhsh, S. and Buckingham, M. (1995) Development 121, 4077-4083). We have now further characterized these Myf5 expressing neurons. Retrograde labeling with diI, and the use of a transgenic mouse line expressing lacZ under the control of Myf5 regulatory sequences, show that Myf5 transcription provides a novel axonal marker of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (mlf) and the mammillotegmental tract (mtt), the earliest longitudinal tracts to be established in the embryonic mouse brain. Tracts projecting caudally from the developing olfactory system are also labelled. nlacZ and lacZ expression persist in the adult brain, in a few ventral domains such as the mammillary bodies of the hypothalamus and the interpeduncular nucleus, potentially derived from the embryonic structures where the Myf5 gene is transcribed. To investigate the role of Myf5 in the brain, we monitored Myf5 protein accumulation by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting in neurons transcribing the gene. Although Myf5 was detected in muscle myotomal cells, it was absent in neurons. This would account for the lack of myogenic conversion in brain structures and the absence of a neural phenotype in homozygous null mutants. RT-PCR experiments show that the splicing of Myf5 primary transcripts occurs correctly in neurons, suggesting that the lack of Myf5 protein accumulation is due to regulation at the level of mRNA translation or protein stability. In the embryonic neuroepithelium, Myf5 is transcribed in differentiated neurons after the expression of neural basic Helix-Loop-Helix transcription factors. The signalling molecules Wnt1 and Sonic hedgehog, implicated in the activation of Myf5 in myogenic progenitor cells in the somite, are also produced in the viscinity of the Myf5 expression domain in the mesencephalon. We show that cells expressing Wnt1 can activate neuronal Myf5-nlacZ gene expression in dissected head explants isolated from E9.5 embryos. Furthermore, the gene encoding the basic Helix-Loop-Helix transcription factor mSim1 is expressed in adjacent cells in both the somite and the brain, suggesting that signalling molecules necessary for the activation of mSim1 as well as Myf5 are present at these different sites in the embryo. This phenomenon may be widespread and it remains to be seen how many other potentially potent regulatory genes, in addition to Myf5, when activated do not accumulate protein at inappropriate sites in the embryo.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"10677508","pmcid":null,"title":"Zic2 regulates the kinetics of neurulation.","authors":["Nagai T","Aruga J","Minowa O","Sugimoto T","Ohno Y","Noda T","Mikoshiba K"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","journalShort":"Proc.

The differences in the phenotype between the two mutations suggest that the orpk mutation is a hypomorphic allele of the Tg737 gene. Unlike the orpk allele, where all homozygotes survive to birth, embryos homozygous for the Tg737(Delta)2-3(beta)Gal) mutation arrest in development at mid-gestation and exhibit neural tube defects, enlargement of the pericardial sac and, most notably, left-right asymmetry defects. At mid-gestation the direction of heart looping is randomized, and at earlier stages in development lefty-2 and nodal, which are normally expressed asymmetrically, exhibit symmetrical expression in the mutant embryos. Additionally, we determined that the ventral node cells in mutant embryos fail to express the central cilium, which is a characteristic and potentially functional feature of these cells. The expression of both Shh and Hnf3(beta) is downregulated in the midline at E8.0, indicating that there are significant alterations in midline development in the Tg737(Delta)2-3(beta)Gal) homozygous embryos. We propose that the failure of ventral node cells to fully mature alters their ability to undergo differentiation as they migrate out of the node to contribute to the developing midline structures. Analysis of this new knockout allele allows us to define a critical role for the Tg737 gene during early embryogenesis. We have named the product of the Tg737 gene Polaris, which is based on the various polarity related defects associated with the different alleles of the Tg737 gene.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"10753507","pmcid":null,"title":"Targeted misexpression of constitutively active BMP receptor-IB causes bifurcation, duplication, and posterior transformation of digit in mouse limb.","authors":["Zhang Z","Yu X","Zhang Y","Geronimo B","Lovlie A","Fromm SH","Chen Y"],"grantIds":["R01 DE12329"],"grantAgencies":["NIDCR NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Developmental biology","journalShort":"Dev.

In developing limbs, BMPs have been implicated in control of anterior-posterior patterning, outgrowth, chondrogenesis, and apoptosis. These diverse roles of BMPs in limb development are apparently mediated by different BMP receptors (BMPR). To identify the developmental processes in mouse limb possibly contributed by BMP receptor-IB (BMPR-IB), we generated transgenic mice misexpressing a constitutively active Bmpr-IB (caBmpr-IB). The transgene driven by the mouse Hoxb-6 promoter was ectopically expressed in the posterior mesenchyme of the forelimb bud, the lateral plate mesoderm, and the whole mesenchyme of the hindlimb bud. While the forelimbs appeared normal, the transgenic hindlimbs exhibited several phenotypes, including bifurcation, preaxial polydactyly, and posterior transformation of the anterior digit. However, the size of bones in the transgenic limbs seemed unaltered. Defects in sternum and ribs were also found. The bifurcation in the transgenic hindlimb occurred early in the limb development (E10.5) and was associated with extensive cell death in the mesenchyme and occasionally in the apical ectodermal ridge (AER). Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Patched (Ptc) expression appeared unaffected in the transgenic limb buds, suggesting that the BMPR-IB mediated signaling pathway is downstream from Shh. However, ectopic Fgf4 expression was found in the anterior AER, which may account for the duplication of the anterior digit. An ectopic expression of Gremlin found in the transgenic limb bud would be responsible for the ectopic Fgf4 expression. The observations that Hoxd-12 and Hoxd-13 expression patterns were extended anteriorly provide a molecular basis for the posterior transformation of the anterior digit. Together these results suggest that BMPR-IB is the endogenous receptor to mediate the role of BMPs in anterior-posterior patterning and apoptosis in mouse developing limb. In addition, BMPR-IB may represent a critical component in the Shh/FGF4 feedback loop by regulating Gremlin expression.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"10742113","pmcid":null,"title":"Mutations in Sox18 underlie cardiovascular and hair follicle defects in ragged mice.","authors":["Pennisi D","Gardner J","Chambers D","Hosking B","Peters J","Muscat G","Abbott C","Koopman P"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Nature genetics","journalShort":"Nat.

In order to discriminate between overlapping versus unique requirements for the three Gli genes in mice, we have produced a Gli1 mutant and analyzed the phenotypes of Gli1/Gli2 and Gli1/3 double mutants. Gli3(xt) mutants have polydactyly and dorsal CNS defects associated with ectopic Shh expression, indicating GLI3 plays a role in repressing Shh. In contrast, Gli2 mutants have five digits, but lack a floorplate, indicating that it is required to transduce SHH signaling in some tissues. Remarkably, mice homozygous for a Gli1(zfd )mutation that deletes the exons encoding the DNA-binding domain are viable and appear normal. Transgenic mice expressing a GLI1 protein lacking the zinc fingers can not induce SHH targets in the dorsal brain, indicating that the Gli1(zfd )allele contains a hypomorphic or null mutation. Interestingly, Gli1(zfd/zfd);Gli2(zfd/+), but not Gli1(zfd/zfd);Gli3(zfd/+) double mutants have a severe phenotype; most Gli1(zfd/zfd);Gli2(zfd/+) mice die soon after birth and all have multiple defects including a variable loss of ventral spinal cord cells and smaller lungs that are similar to, but less extreme than, Gli2(zfd/zfd) mutants.

The double-knockout (dKO) embryos died around 9.5 days postcoitum (dpc) without developing any posterior structures such as heart, somites or gut. The major defect in this double-knockout embryo was the apparent lack of any mesodermal layer between the endoderm and ectoderm. The abnormal accumulation of cells in the primitive streak indicates a defect in the migratory activity of mesodermal cells. Molecular markers employed to characterize the phenotype revealed a lack of the cranio-cardiac and paraxial mesoderm.

We have generated three deletion complexes in ES (Embryonic Stem) cells that collectively span approximately 40 cM of proximal mouse chromosome 5. The deletion complexes were produced by irradiation of F(1) hybrid ES cells containing herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase genes (tk) integrated at the Dpp6, Hdh (Huntington disease locus), or Gabrb1 loci, followed by selection for tk-deficient clones. Deletions centered at the adjacent Hdh and Dpp6 loci ranged up to approximately 20 cM or more in length and overlapped in an interdigitated fashion. However, the interval between Hdh and Gabrb1 appeared to contain a locus haploinsufficient for ES cell viability, thereby preventing deletions of either complex from overlapping. In some cases, the deletions resolved the order of markers that were previously genetically inseparable. A subset of the ES cell-bearing deletions was injected into blastocysts to generate germline chimeras and establish lines of mice segregating the deletion chromosomes.

The primitive streak and node become disfigured, consistent with evidence that cell migration is impaired in newly formed mesoderm. Additional defects related to mesoderm development include notochord degeneration, somite malformations, and abnormal vascular development. Arrested heart looping morphogenesis and a randomized direction of embryonic turning indicate that left-right development is also perturbed. The expression of nodal and leftb, Tgf-beta-related genes involved in a left-determinant signaling pathway, is variably lost in the left lateral plate mesoderm. Mutational analysis has demonstrated that Fgf8 and Brachyury (T) are required for normal mesoderm and left-right development and the asymmetric expression of nodal and leftb. Fgf8 expression in nascent mesoderm exiting the primitive streak is dramatically reduced in mutant embryos, and diminished T expression accompanies the progressive loss of paraxial, lateral, and primitive streak mesoderm. In contrast, axial mesoderm persists and T and nodal appear to be appropriately expressed in their specific domains in the node and notochord.

Teeth develop by a well recorded series of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, similar to those in hair follicle and sweat gland development, the structures found to be defective in tabby and downless mice. We have analysed the downless mutant teeth in detail, and have traced the defect in cusp morphology back to initial defects in the structure of the tooth enamel knot at E13. Significantly, the defect is distinct from that of the tabby mutant. In the tabby mutant, there is a recognisable but small enamel knot, whereas in the downless mutant the knot is absent, but enamel knot cells are organised into a different shape, the enamel rope, showing altered expression of signalling factors (Shh, Fgf4, Bmp4 and Wnt10b). By adding a soluble form of Edar to tooth germs, we were able to mimic the tabby enamel knot phenotype, demonstrating the involvement of endogenous Eda in tooth development. We could not, however, reproduce the downless phenotype, suggesting the existence of yet another ligand or receptor, or of ligand-independent activation mechanisms for Edar. Changes in the structure of the enamel knot signalling centre in downless tooth germs provide functional data directly linking the enamel knot with tooth cusp morphogenesis. We also show that the Lef1 pathway, thought to be involved in these mutants, functions independently in a parallel pathway.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"10995442","pmcid":"2150711","title":"Essential role of Gab1 for signaling by the c-Met receptor in vivo.","authors":["Sachs M","Brohmann H","Zechner D","Müller T","Hülsken J","Walther I","Schaeper U","Birchmeier C","Birchmeier W"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"The Journal of cell biology","journalShort":"J.

Gab1 is essential for several steps in development: migration of myogenic precursor cells into the limb anlage is impaired in Gab1-/- embryos. As a consequence, extensor muscle groups of the forelimbs are virtually absent, and the flexor muscles reach less far. Fewer hindlimb muscles exist, which are smaller and disorganized. Muscles in the diaphragm, which also originate from migratory precursors, are missing. Moreover, Gab1-/- embryos die in a broad time window between E13.5 and E18.5, and display reduced liver size and placental defects. The labyrinth layer, but not the spongiotrophoblast layer, of the placenta is severely reduced, resulting in impaired communication between maternal and fetal circulation. Thus, extensive similarities between the phenotypes of c-Met and HGF/SF mutant mice exist, and the muscle migration phenotype is even more pronounced in Gab1-/-:c-Met+/- embryos.

The proper connection of the ossicle chain with the tympanic membrane, provided by the insertion of the manubrium of the malleus into the eardrum, is essential for the functionality of the hearing apparatus. We describe here the mechanisms regulating the development of the manubrium and its integration into the tympanic membrane. We show that the external acoustic meatus (EAM), which eventually forms the outer epithelium of the tympanic membrane, plays an essential role in this developmental process. Histological and expression analyses indicate that the manubrium develops close to the EAM with a similar temporal sequence. In addition, when the middle ear ossicles are allowed to develop in vitro under conditions that do not support further EAM development, the manubrium develops only up to the stage of its induction at the time of explantation. Moreover, genetically or teratogenically derived alterations in the EAM also have an effect on manubrial development. Finally, we show that the EAM is the source of two quite opposite activities, one that induces chondrogenesis and another that represses it. The combination of these two activities results in the proper positioning of the manubrium.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"11017169","pmcid":null,"title":"Specification of ventral neuron types is mediated by an antagonistic interaction between Shh and Gli3.","authors":["Litingtung Y","Chiang C"],"grantIds":["HD37489","N01-HD-7-3263"],"grantAgencies":["NICHD NIH HHS","NICHD NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Nature neuroscience","journalShort":"Nat.

Gsh2 mutants have a significant decrease in the expression of numerous genes that mark early development of the lateral ganglionic eminence, the striatal anlage. Accompanying this early loss of patterning genes is an initial expansion of dorsal telencephalic markers across the cortical-striatal boundary into the lateral ganglionic eminence. Interestingly, as development proceeds, there is compensation for this early loss of markers that is coincident with a molecular re-establishment of the cortical-striatal boundary. Despite this compensation, there is a defect in the development of distinct subpopulations of striatal neurons. Moreover, while our analysis suggests that the migration of the ventrally derived interneurons to the developing cerebral cortex is not significantly affected in Gsh2 mutants, there is a distinct delay in the appearance of GABAergic interneurons in the olfactory bulb.

We have investigated how Shh expression and cell death respond when levels of polarising activity are altered, and show an autoregulatory effect of Shh on Shh expression and that Shh affects cell death in the posterior necrotic zone. When we increased Shh signalling, by grafting polarising region cells or applying Shh protein beads, this led to a reduction in the endogenous Shh domain and an increase in posterior cell death. In contrast, cells in other necrotic regions of the limb bud, including the interdigital areas, were rescued from death by Shh protein. Application of Shh protein to late limb buds also caused alterations in digit morphogenesis. When we reduced the number of Shh-expressing cells in the polarising region by surgery or drug-induced killing, this led to an expansion of the Shh domain and a decrease in the number of dead cells. Furthermore, direct prevention of cell death using a retroviral vector expressing Bcl2 led to an increase in Shh expression. Finally, we provide evidence that the fate of some of the Shh-expressing cells in the polarising region is to undergo apoptosis and contribute to the posterior necrotic zone during normal limb development.

Shh(-)(/)(-) and Shh(-)(/)(-) Ihh(+/)(-) mutants have a threefold increase in pancreas mass, and a fourfold increase in pancreatic endocrine cell numbers. In contrast, mutations in Ptc1 reduce pancreas gene expression and impair glucose homeostasis. Thus, islet cell, pancreatic mass and pancreatic morphogenesis are regulated by hedgehog signaling molecules expressed within and adjacent to the embryonic pancreas. Defects in hedgehog signaling may lead to congenital pancreatic malformations and glucose intolerance.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"11076756","pmcid":null,"title":"Hoxb1 controls effectors of sonic hedgehog and Mash1 signaling pathways.","authors":["Gaufo GO","Flodby P","Capecchi MR"],"grantIds":["N01-HD-62915"],"grantAgencies":["NICHD NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":2,"month":12,"year":2000,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Apoptosis","Base Sequence","Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors","Body Patterning","Cell Movement","DNA Primers","DNA-Binding Proteins","Epistasis, Genetic","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Genes, Homeobox","Green Fluorescent Proteins","Hedgehog Proteins","Homeodomain Proteins","Luminescent Proteins","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Mice, Knockout","Mice, Transgenic","Motor Neurons","Proteins","Rhombencephalon","Signal Transduction","Trans-Activators","Transcription Factors"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"The diverse neuronal subtypes in the adult central nervous system arise from progenitor cells specified by the combined actions of anteroposterior (AP) and dorsoventral (DV) signaling molecules in the neural tube.

A novel high-throughput 384-format capillary sequencer system (RISA sequencer system) was developed for the sequencing process. This system consists of a 384-multicapillary auto sequencer (RISA sequencer), a 384-multicapillary array assembler (CAS), and a 384-multicapillary casting device.

Complex feedback loops exist between Shh in the ZPA, Bmps and their antagonists in the adjacent mesenchyme, Wnt7a in the dorsal ectoderm and Fgfs in the AER. In contrast to the previously reported complete absence of digits in Shh(-/-) mice, we show that one morphologically distinct digit, with a well-delineated nail and phalanges, forms in Shh(-/-) hindlimbs, while intermediate structures are severely truncated and fused. The presence of distal autopod elements is consistent with weak expression of Hoxd13 in Shh(-/-) hindlimbs. Shh(-/-) forelimbs in contrast have one distal cartilage element, a less-well differentiated nail and fused intermediate bones. Interestingly, Ihh is expressed at the tip of Shh mutant limbs and could account for formation of distal structures. In contrast to previous studies we also demonstrate that Shh signaling is required for maintenance of normal Fgf8 expression, since expression of Fgf8, unlike some other AER marker genes, is rapidly lost from anterior to posterior after E10.5, with only a small domain of Fgf8 expression remaining posteriorly. Furthermore, loss of expanded Fgf8 expression is paralleled by a collapse of the handplate. Our data show that development of most intermediate elements of the hindlimb skeleton are Shh-dependent, and that Shh signaling is required for anterior-posterior expansion of the AER in both limbs and for the subsequent branching of zeugopod and autopod elements.

Mice in which Lhx2 is disrupted were reported to have reduced telencephalic development, and the hippocampal primordium appeared to be missing, by morphological observation. We hypothesized that this may be due to a defect in the cortical hem, a Wnt- and Bmp-rich putative signaling center in the medial telencephalon, a source of regulatory signals for hippocampal development. We asked if the expression of any known hem-specific signaling molecule is deficient in Lhx2-/- mice. Our results reveal, unexpectedly, that at embryonic day (E)12.5, what appears to be some spared 'lateral' cortex is instead an expanded cortical hem. Normally restricted to the extreme medial edge of the telencephalon, the hem covers almost the entire dorsal telencephalon in the Lhx2-/- mice. This indicates a role for Lhx2 in the regulation of the extent of the cortical hem. In spite of an expanded, mislocated hem in the Lhx2-/- telencephalon, a potential source of ectopic dorsalizing cues, no hippocampal differentiation is detected in tissue adjacent to the mutant hem, nor does the overall dorsoventral patterning appear perturbed.

Shh is expressed throughout the ventral diencephalon and the oral ectoderm, but its expression is subsequently absent from the nascent Rathke's pouch as soon as it becomes morphologically visible, creating a Shh boundary within the oral epithelium. We used oral ectoderm/Rathke's pouch-specific 5' regulatory sequences (Pitx1(HS)) from the bicoid related pituitary homeobox gene (Pitx1) to target overexpression of the Hedgehog inhibitor Hip (Huntingtin interacting protein) to block Hedgehog signaling, finding that SHH is required for proliferation of the pituitary gland. In addition, we provide evidence that Hedgehog signaling, acting at the Shh boundary within the oral ectoderm, may exert a role in differentiation of ventral cell types (gonadotropes and thyrotropes) by inducing Bmp2 expression in Rathke's pouch, which subsequently regulates expression of ventral transcription factors, particularly Gata2. Furthermore, our data suggest that Hedgehog signaling, together with FGF8/10 signaling, synergizes to regulate expression of the LIM homeobox gene Lhx3, which has been proved to be essential for initial pituitary gland formation.

The limb muscle defect became apparent relatively late and initial stages of hypaxial muscle development were unaffected or only slightly delayed.

Our data suggest that Shh acts similarly in both somitic compartments as a survival and proliferation factor and not as a primary inducer of myogenesis.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"11290295","pmcid":null,"title":"Mesodermal patterning defect in mice lacking the Ste20 NCK interacting kinase (NIK).","authors":["Xue Y","Wang X","Li Z","Gotoh N","Chapman D","Skolnik EY"],"grantIds":["DK49207","GM58573"],"grantAgencies":["NIDDK NIH HHS","NIGMS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":6,"month":5,"year":2001,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Body Patterning","Chimera","Drosophila Proteins","Embryo Loss","Fibroblast Growth Factors","Gastrula","Gene Targeting","Genes, Lethal","Homozygote","In Situ Hybridization","Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins","JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases","MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases","Mesoderm","Mice","Mice, Knockout","Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases","Nervous System","Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases","Recombination, Genetic","Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins","Signal Transduction","Somites","Stem Cells"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"We have previously shown that the Drosophila Ste20 kinase encoded by misshapen (msn) is an essential gene in Drosophila development. msn function is required to activate the Drosophila c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), basket (Bsk), to promote dorsal closure of the Drosophila embryo. Later in development, msn expression is required in photoreceptors in order for their axons to project normally. A mammalian homolog of msn, the NCK-interacting kinase (NIK) (recently renamed to mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4; Map4k4), has been shown to activate JNK and to bind the SH3 domains of the SH2/SH3 adapter NCK. To determine whether NIK also plays an essential role in mammalian development, we created mice deficient in NIK by homologous recombination at the Nik gene. Nik(-/-) mice die postgastrulation between embryonic day (E) 9.5 and E10.5. The most striking phenotype in Nik(-/-) embryos is the failure of mesodermal and endodermal cells that arise from the anterior end of the primitive streak (PS) to migrate to their correct location. As a result Nik(-/- )embryos fail to develop somites or a hindgut and are truncated posteriorly. Interestingly, chimeric analysis demonstrated that NIK has a cell nonautonomous function in stimulating migration of presomitic mesodermal cells away from the PS and a second cell autonomous function in stimulating the differentiation of presomitic mesoderm into dermomyotome. These findings indicate that despite the large number of Ste20 kinases in mammalian cells, members of this family play essential nonredundant function in regulating specific signaling pathways. In addition, these studies provide evidence that the signaling pathways regulated by these kinases are diverse and not limited to the activation of JNK because mesodermal and somite development are not perturbed in JNK1-, and JNK2-deficient mice.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"11287183","pmcid":null,"title":"Evidence that SPROUTY2 functions as an inhibitor of mouse embryonic lung growth and morphogenesis.","authors":["Mailleux AA","Tefft D","Ndiaye D","Itoh N","Thiery JP","Warburton D","Bellusci S"],"grantIds":["H244977"],"grantAgencies":["PHS HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Mechanisms of development","journalShort":"Mech.

Studies in Drosophila and chick have shown that members of the SPROUTY family are inducible negative regulators of growth factors that act through tyrosine kinase receptors. We and others have shown that Fibroblast Growth Factor 10 (FGF10) is a key positive regulator of lung branching morphogenesis. Herein, we provide direct evidence that mSprouty2 is dynamically expressed in the peripheral endoderm in embryonic lung and is downregulated in the clefts between new branches at E12.5. We found that mSprouty2 was expressed in a domain restricted in time and space, adjacent to that of Fgf10 in the peripheral mesenchyme. By E14.5, Fgf10 expression was restricted to a narrow domain of mesenchyme along the extreme edges of the individual lung lobes, whereas mSprouty2 was most highly expressed in the subjacent epithelial terminal buds. FGF10 beads upregulated the expression of mSprouty2 in adjacent epithelium in embryonic lung explant culture. Lung cultures treated with exogenous FGF10 showed greater branching and higher levels of mSpry2 mRNA. Conversely, Fgf10 antisense oligonucleotides reduced branching and decreased mSpry2 mRNA levels. However, treatment with exogenous FGF10 or antisense Fgf10 did not change Shh and FgfR2 mRNA levels in the lungs. We investigated Sprouty2 function during lung development by two different but complementary approaches. The targeted overexpression of mSprouty2 in the peripheral lung epithelium in vivo, using the Surfactant Protein C promoter, resulted in a low level of branching, lung lobe edges abnormal in appearance and the inhibition of epithelial proliferation. Transient high-level overexpression of mSpry2 throughout the pulmonary epithelium by intra-tracheal adenovirus microinjection also resulted in a low level of branching. These results indicate for the first time that mSPROUTY2 functions as a negative regulator of embryonic lung morphogenesis and growth.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"11290297","pmcid":null,"title":"Mice doubly deficient for the Polycomb Group genes Mel18 and Bmi1 reveal synergy and requirement for maintenance but not initiation of Hox gene expression.","authors":["Akasaka T","van Lohuizen M","van der Lugt N","Mizutani-Koseki Y","Kanno M","Taniguchi M","Vidal M","Alkema M","Berns A","Koseki H"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":6,"month":5,"year":2001,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Bone and Bones","DNA-Binding Proteins","Embryonic and Fetal Development","Gene Dosage","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Genes, Homeobox","Homeodomain Proteins","Mice","Mice, Mutant Strains","Nuclear Proteins","Polycomb Repressive Complex 1","Polycomb-Group Proteins","Proto-Oncogene Proteins","Repressor Proteins"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Polycomb group genes were identified as a conserved group of genes whose products are required in multimeric complexes to maintain spatially restricted expression of Hox cluster genes.

METHODS: Mutant mice involving Shh signaling, the Shh transcription factors Gli2-/- and Gli3-/-, Gli2-/-;Gli3+/- double heterozygotes, and Shh-/- were analyzed. RESULTS: In addition to reported vertebral, anal, tracheoesophageal, and limb anomalies, mutant mice display cardiac, renal, and associated anomalies, namely congenital diaphragmatic hernia and omphalocele, known to be associated in VACTERL syndrome. The Shh transcription factors Gli2 and Gli3 have specific and overlapping roles in the induction of VACTERL phenotypes in a gene-dose dependent manner in these mutants.

We show that in the forebrain, expression of the early oligodendrocyte markers Olig2, plp/dm20 and PDGFR(alpha) corresponds to regions of Shh expression. To directly test if Shh can induce the development of oligodendrocytes within the telencephalon, we use retroviral vectors to ectopically express Shh within the mouse embryonic telencephalon. We find that infections with Shh-expressing retrovirus at embryonic day 9.5, result in ectopic Olig2 and PDGFR(alpha) expression by mid-embryogenesis. By postnatal day 21, cells expressing ectopic Shh overwhelmingly adopt an oligodendrocyte identity. To determine if the loss of telencephalic Shh correspondingly results in the loss of oligodendrocyte production, we studied Nkx2.1 mutant mice in which telencephalic expression of Shh is selectively lost. In accordance with Shh playing a role in oligodendrogenesis, within the medial ganglionic eminence of Nkx2.1 mutants, the early expression of PDGFR(alpha) is absent and the level of Olig2 expression is diminished in this region. In addition, in these same mutants, expression of both Shh and plp/dm20 is lost in the hypothalamus. Notably, in the prospective amygdala region where Shh expression persists in the Nkx2.1 mutant, the presence of plp/dm20 is unperturbed. Further supporting the idea that Shh is required for the in vivo establishment of early oligodendrocyte populations, expression of PDGFR(alpha) can be partially rescued by virally mediated expression of Shh in the Nkx2.1 mutant telencephalon. Interestingly, despite the apparent requirement for Shh for oligodendrocyte specification in vivo, all regions of either wild-type or Nkx2.1 mutant telencephalon are competent to produce oligodendrocytes in vitro. Furthermore, analysis of CNS tissue from Shh null animals definitively shows that, in vitro, Shh is not required for the generation of oligodendrocytes. We propose that oligodendrocyte specification is negatively regulated in vivo and that Shh generates oligodendrocytes by overcoming this inhibition. Furthermore, it appears that a Shh-independent pathway for generating oligodendrocytes exists.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"11291865","pmcid":null,"title":"Defects of the body plan of mutant embryos lacking Lim1, Otx2 or Hnf3beta activity.","authors":["Kinder SJ","Tsang TE","Ang SL","Behringer RR","Tam PP"],"grantIds":["MC_U117570533"],"grantAgencies":["Medical Research Council"],"retractions":[],"journal":"The International journal of developmental biology","journalShort":"Int.

We show that the profile of Klf7 expression predominantly involves the central and peripheral nervous systems and is broadly identified by three separate phases. The first phase occurs early in embryogenesis with increasingly strong expression in the spinal cord, notably in motor neurons of the ventral horn, in dorsal root ganglia, and in sympathetic ganglia. The second robust phase of Klf7 expression is confined to the early postnatal cerebral cortex and is downregulated thereafter. The third phase is characterized by high and sustained expression in the adult cerebellum and dorsal root ganglia. Functionally, these three phases coincide with establishment of neuronal phenotype in embryonic spinal cord, with synaptogenesis and development of mature synaptic circuitry in the postnatal cerebral cortex, and with survival and/or maintenance of function of adult sensory neurons and cerebellar granule cells. Consistent with Klf7 expression in newly formed neuroblasts, overexpression of the gene in cultured fibroblasts and neuroblastoma cells repressed cyclin D1, activated p21, and led to G1 growth arrest. Based on these data, we argue for multiple potential functions for KLF7 in the developing and adult nervous system; they include participating in differentiation and maturation of several neuronal subtypes and in phenotypic maintenance of mature cerebellar granule cells and dorsal root ganglia.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"11311154","pmcid":null,"title":"Indian hedgehog activates hematopoiesis and vasculogenesis and can respecify prospective neurectodermal cell fate in the mouse embryo.","authors":["Dyer MA","Farrington SM","Mohn D","Munday JR","Baron MH"],"grantIds":["DK52191","GM42413"],"grantAgencies":["NIDDK NIH HHS","NIGMS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":20,"month":5,"year":2001,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Base Sequence","Blood Vessels","Body Patterning","Cell Division","DNA Primers","Embryonic Induction","Embryonic and Fetal Development","Endoderm","Gastrula","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Hedgehog Proteins","Hematopoiesis","Humans","Mice","Mice, Transgenic","Models, Biological","Proteins","Signal Transduction","Trans-Activators"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"During gastrulation in the mouse, mesoderm is induced and patterned by secreted signaling molecules, giving rise first to primitive erythroblasts and vascular endothelial cells.

We propose that VACTERL could be caused by defective Shh signaling during human embryogenesis and suggest that the Gli mutant mice can serve as useful models for studying the pathogenesis of VACTERL.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"11311163","pmcid":null,"title":"Genetic dissection of nodal function in patterning the mouse embryo.","authors":["Lowe LA","Yamada S","Kuehn MR"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":20,"month":5,"year":2001,"meshHeadings":["Alleles","Animals","Body Patterning","Female","Gastrula","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Heterozygote","Male","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Mice, Knockout","Mutation","Nodal Protein","Phenotype","Signal Transduction","Transforming Growth Factor beta"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Loss-of-function analysis has shown that the transforming growth factor-like signaling molecule nodal is essential for mouse mesoderm development.

The latter includes perturbation of rhombomeric boundaries as detected by Krox20 and Hoxb1. PECAM-1 staining of embryos revealed normal formation of the primary vascular plexus. However, subsequent stages of branching and remodeling do not proceed normally in the yolk sac and in the embryo proper. To obtain insights into the circling behavior, we examined development of the inner ear by paint-filling of membranous labyrinths of Whl/+ embryos. This analysis revealed smaller posterior and lateral semicircular canal primordia and a delay in the canal fusion process at E12.5.

Drosophila Hh-N has been shown to act via both short- and long-range signaling. In vertebrates, however, attempts to directly demonstrate Shh (SHH) or Ihh (IHH) proteins at a distance from producing cells have been largely unsuccessful. Furthermore, the fact that the Hh N peptides occur in a cholesterol-modified, membrane-tethered form is not easily reconciled with long-range signaling. This study used optimized immunohistochemistry combined with tissue separation and biochemical analyses in vivo and in vitro to determine the range of action of SHH and IHH in the mouse embryo. In all embryonic structures studied, we detect signaling peptides in producing cells, but we also find that ligands move over considerable distances depending on the tissue. These data provide direct evidence for the presence of Hedgehog signaling peptides in target compartments, suggesting a direct long-range action without a need for secondary mediators. Visualization of Hedgehog proteins in target tissues was achieved only under conditions that allowed proteoglycan/glycosaminoglycan (PG/GAG) preservation. Furthermore, we show that induced changes of the composition of PG/GAG in the tooth alter SHH signaling.

In the Shh(-/-) mutant mouse, the development of many embryonic structures, including the limb, is severely compromised. In this study, we report the analysis of Shh(-/-) mutant limbs in detail. Each mutant embryo has four limbs with recognizable humerus/femur bones that have anterior-posterior polarity. Distal to the elbow/knee joints, skeletal elements representing the zeugopod form but lack identifiable anterior-posterior polarity. Therefore, Shh specifically becomes necessary for normal limb development at or just distal to the stylopod/zeugopod junction (elbow/knee joints) during mouse limb development. The forelimb autopod is represented by a single distal cartilage element, while the hindlimb autopod is invariably composed of a single digit with well-formed interphalangeal joints and a dorsal nail bed at the terminal phalanx. Analysis of GDF5 and Hoxd11-13 expression in the hindlimb autopod suggests that the forming digit has a digit-one identity. This finding is corroborated by the formation of only two phalangeal elements which are unique to digit one on the foot. The apical ectodermal ridge (AER) is induced in the Shh(-/-) mutant buds with relatively normal morphology. We report that the architecture of the Shh(-/-) AER is gradually disrupted over developmental time in parallel with a reduction of Fgf8 expression in the ridge. Concomitantly, abnormal cell death in the Shh(-/-) limb bud occurs in the anterior mesenchyme of both fore- and hindlimb. It is notable that the AER changes and mesodermal cell death occur earlier in the Shh(-/-) forelimb than the hindlimb bud. This provides an explanation for the hindlimb-specific competence to form autopodial structures in the mutant. Finally, unlike the wild-type mouse limb bud, the Shh(-/-) mutant posterior limb bud mesoderm does not cause digit duplications when grafted to the anterior border of chick limb buds, and therefore lacks polarizing activity. We propose that a prepattern exists in the limb field for the three axes of the emerging limb bud as well as specific limb skeletal elements. According to this model, the limb bud signaling centers, including the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) acting through Shh, are required to elaborate upon the axial information provided by the native limb field prepattern.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"11493531","pmcid":null,"title":"Lung hypoplasia and neonatal death in Fgf9-null mice identify this gene as an essential regulator of lung mesenchyme.","authors":["Colvin JS","White AC","Pratt SJ","Ornitz DM"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":8,"month":6,"year":2001,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Cell Line","Female","Fibroblast Growth Factor 10","Fibroblast Growth Factor 9","Fibroblast Growth Factors","Gene Expression","Hedgehog Proteins","Lung","Male","Mesoderm","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Mice, Knockout","Trans-Activators"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Mammalian lung develops as an evagination of ventral gut endoderm into the underlying mesenchyme.

The Pitx2 homeobox gene plays an important role in the final stages of asymmetry. We have used two new Pitx2 alleles that encode progressively higher levels of Pitx2c in the absence of Pitx2a and Pitx2b, to show that different organs have distinct requirements for Pitx2c dosage. The cardiac atria required low Pitx2c levels, while the duodenum and lungs used higher Pitx2c doses for normal development. As Pitx2c levels were elevated, the duodenum progressed from arrested rotation to randomization, reversal and finally normal morphogenesis. In addition, abnormal duodenal morphogenesis was correlated with bilateral expression of Pitx2c. These data reveal an organ-intrinsic mechanism, dependent upon dosage of Pitx2c, that governs asymmetric organ morphogenesis.

The spectrum of anorectal malformations ranges from the mildly stenotic anus to imperforate anus with a fistula between the urinary and intestinal tracts to the most severe form, persistent cloaca. The etiology, embryology, and pathogenesis of anorectal malformations are poorly understood and controversial. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is an endoderm-derived signaling molecule that induces mesodermal gene expression in the chick hindgut. However, the role of Shh signaling in mammalian hindgut development is unknown. Here, we show that mutant mice with various defects in the Shh signaling pathway exhibit a spectrum of distal hindgut defects mimicking human anorectal malformations.

In this study, we have examined Nkx2.2 expression in rodent glial precursors and studied the effect of a loss of Nkx2.2 on oligodendrocyte and astrocyte differentiation. We show that Nkx2.2 is also expressed in mammalian oligodendrocyte progenitors and that the differentiation of MBP-positive and PLP-DM20-positive oligodendrocytes is dramatically retarded in Nkx2.2-null mutants along the entire rostrocaudal axis. In contrast, no effect is seen on astrocytic differentiation.

We show that OLPs in the embryonic mouse forebrain express platelet-derived growth factor alpha-receptors (PDGFRA), as they do in more caudal regions.

Pdgfra-positive progenitors later spread through the forebrain into areas where Shh is not expressed, including the cerebral cortex. Cyclopamine inhibited OLP development in cultures of mouse basal forebrain, suggesting that hedgehog (HH) signalling is obligatory for oligodendrogenesis in the ventral telencephalon. Moreover, Pdgfra-positive progenitors did not appear on schedule in the ventral forebrains of Nkx2.1 null mice, which lack the telencephalic domain of Shh expression.

The combination of an ectoderm-specific regulatory mutation in the Hoxb1 locus and the Hoxa1 mutant genetic background results in an ectoderm-specific double mutation, leaving the other germ layers impaired only in Hoxa1 function. This has allowed us to examine neural crest and arch patterning defects that originate exclusively from the neuroepithelium as a result of the simultaneous loss of Hoxa1 and Hoxb1 in this tissue. Using molecular and lineage analysis in this double mutant background we demonstrate that presumptive rhombomere 4, the major site of origin of the second pharyngeal arch neural crest, is reduced in size and has lost the ability to generate neural crest cells. Grafting experiments using wild-type cells in cultured normal or double mutant mouse embryos demonstrate that this is a cell-autonomous defect, suggesting that the formation or generation of cranial neural crest has been uncoupled from segmental identity in these mutants. Furthermore, we show that loss of the second arch neural crest population does not have any adverse consequences on early patterning of the second arch. Signalling molecules are expressed correctly and pharyngeal pouch and epibranchial placode formation are unaffected. There are no signs of excessive cell death or loss of proliferation in the epithelium of the second arch, suggesting that the neural crest cells are not the source of any indispensable mitogenic or survival signals. These results illustrate that Hox genes are not only necessary for proper axial specification of the neural crest but that they also play a vital role in the generation of this population itself. Furthermore, they demonstrate that early patterning of the separate components of the pharyngeal arches can proceed independently of neural crest cell migration.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"11641221","pmcid":null,"title":"Severe nasal clefting and abnormal embryonic apoptosis in Alx3/Alx4 double mutant mice.","authors":["Beverdam A","Brouwer A","Reijnen M","Korving J","Meijlink F"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":19,"month":10,"year":2001,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Apoptosis","Craniofacial Abnormalities","DNA-Binding Proteins","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Gestational Age","Homeodomain Proteins","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Mice, Knockout","Mice, Mutant Strains","Nasal Bone","Phenotype","Proteins","Transcription Factors"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"A group of mouse aristaless-related genes has been implicated in functions in the development of the craniofacial skeleton.

Retinoic acid stimulation results in a cascade of HNF-3 induction in which HNF-3alpha is a primary target for retinoic acid action and its increase is required for subsequent induction of HNF-3beta expression. Increased expression of HNF-3beta precedes activation of its known target genes, including transthyretin (TTR), Sonic hedgehog (Shh), HNF-1alpha, HNF-1beta, and HNF-4alpha. In order to examine whether increased HNF-3 expression is sufficient to induce expression of its downstream target genes without retinoic acid stimulation, we have used adenovirus-based expression vectors to increase HNF-3 protein levels in F9 cells.

In addition to two subpallial ventricular foci, the anterior entopeduncular area and the medial ganglionic eminence, the rostral telencephalon also gives rise to oligodendrocytes.

In all these telencephalic ventricular territories, oligodendrocyte progenitors were detected at about the same developmental stage as in the spinal cord.

Shh mediates both long-range and short-range signaling responses in embryonic tissues through the activation and repression of target genes by its Gli transcription factor effectors. Despite the well-established functions of Shh signaling in development and human disease, developmental target genes of Gli regulation are virtually unknown. In this study, we investigate the role of Shh signaling in the control of Myf5, a skeletal muscle regulatory gene for specification of muscle stem cells in vertebrate embryos. In previous genetic studies, we showed that Shh is required for Myf5 expression in the specification of dorsal somite, epaxial muscle progenitors. However, these studies did not distinguish whether Myf5 is a direct target of Gli regulation through long-range Shh signaling, or alternatively, whether Myf5 regulation is a secondary response to Shh signaling. To address this question, we have used transgenic analysis with lacZ reporter genes to characterize an Myf5 transcription enhancer that controls the activation of Myf5 expression in the somite epaxial muscle progenitors in mouse embryos. This Myf5 epaxial somite (ES) enhancer is Shh-dependent, as shown by its complete inactivity in somites of homozygous Shh mutant embryos, and by its reduced activity in heterozygous Shh mutant embryos. Furthermore, Shh and downstream Shh signal transducers specifically induce ES enhancer/luciferase reporters in Shh-responsive 3T3 cells. A Gli-binding site located within the ES enhancer is required for enhancer activation by Shh signaling in transfected 3T3 cells and in epaxial somite progenitors in transgenic embryos. These findings establish that Myf5 is a direct target of long-range Shh signaling through positive regulation by Gli transcription factors, providing evidence that Shh signaling has a direct inductive function in cell lineage specification.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"11748155","pmcid":null,"title":"The Sonic Hedgehog-Gli pathway regulates dorsal brain growth and tumorigenesis.","authors":["Dahmane N","Sánchez P","Gitton Y","Palma V","Sun T","Beyna M","Weiner H","Ruiz i Altaba A"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":18,"month":12,"year":2001,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic","Brain","Brain Neoplasms","Cell Communication","Cell Division","Hedgehog Proteins","Humans","In Vitro Techniques","Mice","Neocortex","Oncogene Proteins","Tectum Mesencephali","Trans-Activators","Transcription Factors","Tumor Cells, Cultured","Veratrum Alkaloids"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"The mechanisms that regulate the growth of the brain remain unclear.

In RA-treated embryos, Fgf8 expression was still detected in the distal GT regions.

The early expression in the dorsal and ventral pancreatic epithelium is transient and spans from embryonic day (e) 8 to e9-e10, whereas the later expression is confined to differentiating beta-cells as they appear. We previously showed that Hlxb9 is critically required for the initiation of the dorsal, but not the ventral, pancreatic program. Here, we demonstrate the requirement for a stringent temporal regulation of Hlxb9 expression during early stages of pancreatic development. In transgenic mice, where Hlxb9 expression, under control of the Ipf1/Pdx1 promoter, was extended beyond e9-e10, the development of the pancreas was drastically perturbed. Morphological analyses showed that the growth and morphogenesis of the pancreatic epithelium was impaired. Moreover, differentiation of pancreatic endocrine and exocrine cells was diminished and instead the pancreatic epithelium with its adjacent mesenchyme adopted an intestinal-like differentiation program. Together, these data point to a need for a tight temporal regulation of Hlxb9 expression. Thus, a total loss of Hlxb9 expression results in a block of the initiation of the dorsal pancreatic program, while a temporally extended expression of Hlxb9 results in a complete impairment of pancreatic development.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"11850179","pmcid":null,"title":"Nuclear factor I-B (Nfib) deficient mice have severe lung hypoplasia.","authors":["Gründer A","Ebel TT","Mallo M","Schwarzkopf G","Shimizu T","Sippel AE","Schrewe H"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Mechanisms of development","journalShort":"Mech.

Foxa2 encodes a winged-helix transcription factor expressed in signaling centers required for head development, including the AVE, anterior primitive streak, anterior definitive endoderm, and axial mesendoderm. To address Foxa2 function during formation of the head, we used conditional mutants in which Foxa2 function is preserved in extraembryonic tissues during early embryonic stages and inactivated in embryonic tissues after the onset of gastrulation. In Foxa2 conditional mutants, the anterior neural plate and anterior definitive endoderm were initially specified. In contrast, the axial mesendoderm failed to differentiate. At later stages, specification of the anterior neural plate and anterior definitive endoderm was shown to be labile. As a result, head truncations were observed in Foxa2 conditional mutants.

Molecular characterization of the ptc gene of the mes mutant and an allelism test using a ptc knockout allele (ptc(-)) demonstrated that mes is caused by a deletion of the most C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the ptc gene. Since mes homozygous embryos exhibit normal spinal cord development as compared with ptc(-) homozygotes, which die around 10 dpc with severe neural tube defects, the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain lost in mes mutation is dispensable for inhibition of Shh signaling in early embryogenesis.

Midline and dorsolateral bending are regulated by mutually antagonistic signals from the notochord and surface ectoderm. Notochordal signaling induces midline bending and simultaneously inhibits dorsolateral bending. Sonic hedgehog is both necessary and sufficient to inhibit dorsolateral bending, but is neither necessary nor sufficient to induce midline bending, which seems likely to be regulated by another notochordal factor.

In this article, we show that quaking has a previously unsuspected and essential role in blood vessel development. Interestingly, we found that quaking, a nonsecreted protein, is expressed in the yolk sac endoderm, adjacent to the mesodermal site of developing blood islands, where the differentiation of blood and endothelial cells first occurs. Antibodies against PE-CAM-1, TIE-2 and SM-alpha-actin reveal that embryos homozygous for the qk(k2) allele have defective yolk sac vascular remodeling and abnormal vessels in the embryo proper at midgestation, coinciding with the timing of embryonic death. However, these mutants exhibit normal expression of Nkx2.5 and alpha-sarcomeric actin, indicating that cardiac muscle differentiation was normal. Further, they had normal embryonic heart rates in culture, suggesting that cardiac function was not compromised at this stage of embryonic development.

However, whether the mammalian orthologues of these genes are also involved with endoderm formation is not known. We show that Sox17(-/-) mutant embryos are deficient of gut endoderm. The earliest recognisable defect is the reduced occupancy by the definitive endoderm in the posterior and lateral region of the prospective mid- and hindgut of the headfold-stage embryo. The prospective foregut develops properly until the late neural plate stage. Thereafter, elevated levels of apoptosis lead to a reduction in the population of the definitive endoderm in the foregut. In addition, the mid- and hindgut tissues fail to expand. These are accompanied by the replacement of the definitive endoderm in the lateral region of the entire length of the embryonic gut by cells that resemble the visceral endoderm. In the chimeras, although Sox17-null ES cells can contribute unrestrictedly to ectodermal and mesodermal tissues, few of them could colonise the foregut endoderm and they are completely excluded from the mid- and hindgut endoderm.

A conserved intronic enhancer (ASE), containing binding sites for the fork head transcription factor Foxh1, modulates dynamic patterns of Nodal expression during early mouse development. This enhancer is responsible for early activation of Nodal expression in the epiblast and visceral endoderm, and at later stages governs asymmetric expression during LR axis formation. We demonstrate ASE activity is strictly Foxh1 dependent. Loss of this autoregulatory enhancer eliminates transcription in the visceral endoderm and decreases Nodal expression in the epiblast, but causes surprisingly discrete developmental abnormalities. Thus lowering the level of Nodal signaling in the epiblast disrupts both orientation of the AP axis and specification of the definitive endoderm. Targeted removal of the ASE also dramatically reduces left-sided Nodal expression, but the early events controlling LR axis specification are correctly initiated. However loss of the ASE disrupts Lefty2 (Leftb) expression and causes delayed Pitx2 expression leading to late onset, relatively minor LR patterning defects. The feedback loop is thus essential for maintenance of Nodal signals that selectively regulate target gene expression in a temporally and spatially controlled fashion in the mouse embryo.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"12015293","pmcid":null,"title":"Directed differentiation of pluripotent cells to neural lineages: homogeneous formation and differentiation of a neurectoderm population.","authors":["Rathjen J","Haines BP","Hudson KM","Nesci A","Dunn S","Rathjen PD"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":16,"month":6,"year":2002,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Cell Differentiation","Cell Line","Ectoderm","Embryonic and Fetal Development","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Hematopoietic Stem Cells","Humans","In Situ Hybridization","Neural Crest","Neurons","Polymerase Chain Reaction"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"During embryogenesis the central and peripheral nervous systems arise from a neural precursor population, neurectoderm, formed during gastrulation.

The recent cloning of the genes that underlie these syndromes, ectodysplasin (ED1) and the ectodysplasin A receptor (EDAR), and their identification as a novel TNF ligand-receptor pair suggested a role for TNF signaling in embryonic morphogenesis. In the mouse, the genes of the spontaneous mutations Tabby (Ta) and downless (dl) were identified as homologs of ED1 and EDAR, respectively. To gain insight into the function of this signaling pathway in development of skin and hair follicles, we analyzed the expression and regulation of Eda and Edar in wild type as well as Tabby and Lef1 mutant mouse embryos. We show that Eda and Edar expression is confined to the ectoderm and occurs in a pattern that suggests a role of ectodysplasin/Edar signaling in the interactions between the ectodermal compartments and the formation and function of hair placodes. By using skin explant cultures, we further show that this signaling pathway is intimately associated with interactions between the epithelial and mesenchymal tissues. We also find that Ta mutants lack completely the placodes of the first developing tylotrich hairs, and that they do not show patterned expression of placodal genes, including Bmp4, Lef1, Shh, Ptch and Edar, and the genes for beta-catenin and activin A. Finally, we identified activin as a mesenchymal signal that stimulates Edar expression and WNT as a signal that induces Eda expression, suggesting a hierarchy of distinct signaling pathways in the development of skin and hair follicles. In conclusion, we suggest that Eda and Edar are associated with the onset of ectodermal patterning and that ectodysplasin/edar signaling also regulates the morphogenesis of hair follicles.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"12000792","pmcid":null,"title":"The Dlx5 and Dlx6 homeobox genes are essential for craniofacial, axial, and appendicular skeletal development.","authors":["Robledo RF","Rajan L","Li X","Lufkin T"],"grantIds":["AR 43449","DE 013076","DE 013741"],"grantAgencies":["NIAMS NIH HHS","NIDCR NIH HHS","NIDCR NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Genes & development","journalShort":"Genes Dev.","day":1,"month":5,"year":2002,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Body Patterning","Cartilage","DNA-Binding Proteins","Ear","Extremities","Facial Bones","Female","Foot Deformities, Congenital","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Hand Deformities, Congenital","Hindlimb","Homeodomain Proteins","Humans","Mice","Mice, Mutant Strains","Mice, Transgenic","Osteogenesis","Skeleton","Stem Cells","Transcription Factors"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Dlx homeobox genes are mammalian homologs of the Drosophila Distal-less (Dll) gene.

Here we have investigated whether the lack of endogenous RA synthesis affects limb morphogenesis in mutant mouse embryos deficient for the retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (Raldh2/Aldh1a2). These mutants, which have no detectable embryonic RA except in the developing retina, die at E9.5-E10 without any evidence of limb bud formation, but maternal RA supplementation through oral gavage from E7.5 can extend their survival. Such survivors exhibit highly reduced forelimb rudiments, but apparently normal hindlimbs. By providing RA within maternal food, we found both a stage- and dose-dependency for rescue of forelimb growth and patterning. Following RA supplementation from E7.5 to 8.5, mutant forelimbs are markedly hypoplastic and lack anteroposterior (AP) patterning, with a single medial cartilage and 1-2 digit rudiments. RA provided until E9.5 significantly rescues forelimb growth, but cannot restore normal AP patterning. Increasing the RA dose rescues the hypodactyly, but leads to lack of asymmetry of the digit pattern, with abnormally long first digit or symmetrical polydactyly. Mutant forelimb buds are characterized by lack of expression or abnormal distal distribution of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) transcripts, sometimes with highest expression anteriorly. Downregulation or ectopic anterior expression of Fgf4 is also seen. As a result, genes such as Bmp2 or Hoxd genes are expressed symmetrically along the AP axis of the forelimb buds, and/or later, of the autopod. We suggest that RA signaling cooperates with a posteriorly restricted factor such as dHand, to generate a functional zone of polarizing activity (ZPA).","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"12074550","pmcid":null,"title":"Sonic hedgehog signaling from the urethral epithelium controls external genital development.","authors":["Perriton CL","Powles N","Chiang C","Maconochie MK","Cohn MJ"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Developmental biology","journalShort":"Dev.

Proximodistal outgrowth and axial patterning of the genital tubercle are coordinated to give rise to the penis or clitoris. The genital tubercle consists of lateral plate mesoderm, surface ectoderm, and endodermal urethral epithelium derived from the urogenital sinus. We have investigated the molecular control of external genital development in the mouse embryo. Previous work has shown that the genital tubercle has polarizing activity, but the precise location of this activity within the tubercle is unknown. We reasoned that if the tubercle itself is patterned by a specialized signaling region, then polarizing activity may be restricted to a subset of cells. Transplantation of urethral epithelium, but not genital mesenchyme, to chick limbs results in mirror-image duplication of the digits. Moreover, when grafted to chick limbs, the urethral plate orchestrates morphogenetic movements normally associated with external genital development. Signaling activity is therefore restricted to urethral plate cells. Before and during normal genital tubercle outgrowth, urethral plate epithelium expresses Sonic hedgehog (Shh). In mice with a targeted deletion of Shh, external genitalia are absent. Genital swellings are initiated, but outgrowth is not maintained. In the absence of Shh signaling, Fgf8, Bmp2, Bmp4, Fgf10, and Wnt5a are downregulated, and apoptosis is enhanced in the genitalia. These results identify the urethral epithelium as a signaling center of the genital tubercle, and demonstrate that Shh from the urethral epithelium is required for outgrowth, patterning, and cell survival in the developing external genitalia.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"12032320","pmcid":null,"title":"Disruption of a long-range cis-acting regulator for Shh causes preaxial polydactyly.","authors":["Lettice LA","Horikoshi T","Heaney SJ","van Baren MJ","van der Linde HC","Breedveld GJ","Joosse M","Akarsu N","Oostra BA","Endo N","Shibata M","Suzuki M","Takahashi E","Shinka T","Nakahori Y","Ayusawa D","Nakabayashi K","Scherer SW","Heutink P","Hill RE","Noji S"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","journalShort":"Proc.

Based on the knowledge that generalized, prolonged PTCH expression can inhibit the effects of SHH signaling, we tested the hypothesis that localized transient overexpression of PTCH would inhibit the phenotype of SHH-induced accelerated growth of hair follicles. Adenovirus (Ad)-mediated transient over-expression of Shh (AdShh) in telogen (8 weeks) mouse skin induced anagen hair growth as demonstrated by histology and gross appearance. Strikingly, local intradermal administration of a Ptch-expressing adenovirus (AdPtch), but not a Null control adenovirus (AdNull), 18 hours before AdShh injection, significantly blocked this phenotype, with 100% of AdPtch+AdShh mice failing to advance to anagen compared with AdNull+AdShh mice and AdShh mice (30% and 45% failing to advance to anagen, respectively).

Recently, Wnt5a a member of the wingless family of signaling molecules involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and organogenesis, was shown to underlie the outgrowth and P-D morphogenesis of the vertebrate limb. In the current study, we show that Wnt5a is expressed in the mouse lung and plays an important role in lung distal morphogenesis.

In the face of deleted WNT5a activity, both epithelial and mesenchymal cell compartments of the Wnt5a(-/-) lungs exhibit increased cell proliferation. The overall architecture of the mutant lungs is characterized by overexpansion of the distal airways and inhibition of lung maturation as reflected by persistence of thickened intersaccular interstitium.

We have therefore proposed that Shh induces a factor(s) that renders somitic cells competent to chondrify in response to subsequent BMP signals. Recently, we have shown that forced expression of Nkx3.2, a transcriptional repressor induced by Shh, is able to confer chondrogenic competence in somites. In this work, we show that administration of Shh or forced Nkx3.2 expression induces the expression of the transcription factor Sox9 in the somitic tissue. Forced expression of Sox9 can, in turn, induce robust chondrogenesis in somitic mesoderm, provided that BMP signals are present. We have found that in the presence of BMP signals, Sox9 and Nkx3.2 induce each other's expression. Thus, Nkx3.2 may promote axial chondrogenesis by derepressing the expression of Sox9 in somitic mesoderm. Furthermore, forced expression of either Sox9 or Nkx3.2 not only activates expression of cartilage-specific genes in somitic mesoderm, but also promotes the proliferation and survival of the induced chondrocytes in the presence of BMP signals. However, unlike Nkx3.2, Sox9 is able to induce de novo cartilage formation in non-cartilage-forming tissues. Our findings suggest that Shh and BMP signals work in sequence to establish a positive regulatory loop between Sox9 and Nkx3.2, and that Sox9 can subsequently initiate the chondrocyte differentiation program in a variety of cellular environments.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"12118260","pmcid":null,"title":"Conversion of cerebral cortex into basal ganglia in Emx2(-/-) Pax6(Sey/Sey) double-mutant mice.","authors":["Muzio L","Di Benedetto B","DiBenedetto B","Stoykova A","Boncinelli E","Gruss P","Mallamaci A"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Nature neuroscience","journalShort":"Nat.

We have used Msx1-deficient mice as a model system that exhibits severe craniofacial abnormalities, including cleft secondary palate and lack of teeth, to study the genetic regulation of mammalian palatogenesis. We found that Msx1 expression was restricted to the anterior of the first upper molar site in the palatal mesenchyme and that Msx1 was required for the expression of Bmp4 and Bmp2 in the mesenchyme and Shh in the medial edge epithelium (MEE) in the same region of developing palate. In vivo and in vitro analyses indicated that the cleft palate seen in Msx1 mutants resulted from a defect in cell proliferation in the anterior palatal mesenchyme rather than a failure in palatal fusion. Transgenic expression of human Bmp4 driven by the mouse Msx1 promoter in the Msx1(-/-) palatal mesenchyme rescued the cleft palate phenotype and neonatal lethality. Associated with the rescue of the cleft palate was a restoration of Shh and Bmp2 expression, as well as a return of cell proliferation to the normal levels. Ectopic Bmp4 appears to bypass the requirement for Msx1 and functions upstream of Shh and Bmp2 to support palatal development. Further in vitro assays indicated that Shh (normally expressed in the MEE) activates Bmp2 expression in the palatal mesenchyme which in turn acts as a mitogen to stimulate cell division. Msx1 thus controls a genetic hierarchy involving BMP and Shh signals that regulates the growth of the anterior region of palate during mammalian palatogenesis.

Thus, unlike previous models proposed in the chick embryo in which Bmp4 suppresses left-sided gene expression, our results suggest that Bmp acts as a positive facilitator of the left-sided molecular cascade and is required for Nodal induction and maintenance in the left LPM.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"12361967","pmcid":null,"title":"Gli2, but not Gli1, is required for initial Shh signaling and ectopic activation of the Shh pathway.","authors":["Bai CB","Auerbach W","Lee JS","Stephen D","Joyner AL"],"grantIds":["T32 GM007308"],"grantAgencies":["NIGMS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":3,"month":10,"year":2002,"meshHeadings":["Alleles","Animals","Embryonic and Fetal Development","Fetal Death","Hedgehog Proteins","Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors","Membrane Proteins","Mice","Mice, Mutant Strains","Nervous System","Oncogene Proteins","Receptors, Cell Surface","Signal Transduction","Trans-Activators","Transcription Factors","Transcriptional Activation","beta-Galactosidase"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"The Shh signaling pathway is required in many mammalian tissues for embryonic patterning, cell proliferation and differentiation.

To address whether this is the case in mouse, we generated a Gli1 null allele expressing lacZ. Strikingly, Gli1 is not required for mouse development or viability. Of relevance, we show that all transcription of Gli1 in the nervous system and limbs is dependent on Shh and, consequently, Gli1 protein is normally not present to transduce initial Shh signaling.

This suggests that by this point in development regional character in the telencephalon is established. To determine whether this prepattern is dependent on earlier Shh signaling, we examined the telencephalon in mice carrying either Shh- or Gli3-null mutant alleles. This analysis revealed that the expression of a subset of ventral telencephalic markers, including Dlx2 and Gsh2, although greatly diminished, persist in Shh(-/-) mutants, and that these same markers were expanded in Gli3(-/-) mutants. To understand further the genetic interaction between Shh and Gli3, we examined Shh/Gli3 and Smoothened/Gli3 double homozygous mutants. Notably, in animals carrying either of these genetic backgrounds, genes such as Gsh2 and Dlx2, which are expressed pan-ventrally, as well as Nkx2.1, which demarcates the ventral most aspect of the telencephalon, appear to be largely restored to their wild-type patterns of expression. These results suggest that normal patterning in the telencephalon depends on the ventral repression of Gli3 function by Shh and, conversely, on the dorsal repression of Shh signaling by Gli3.

Furthermore, chondrocyte proliferation was severely inhibited and joint formation was defective. Although Indian hedgehog, Patched1, parathyroid hormone-related peptide (Pthrp), and Pth/Pthrp receptor were expressed, their expression was down-regulated. Our experiments further suggested that Sox9 is also needed to prevent conversion of proliferating chondrocytes into hypertrophic chondrocytes. We conclude that Sox9 is required during sequential steps of the chondrocyte differentiation pathway.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"12413903","pmcid":null,"title":"The Fused toes (Ft) mouse mutation causes anteroposterior and dorsoventral polydactyly.","authors":["Grotewold L","Rüther U"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Developmental biology","journalShort":"Dev.

One unusual aspect of Hh signaling is the autoproteolytic processing of Hh followed by lipid modification. As a consequence, the N-terminal fragment of Hh becomes membrane anchored on the cell surface of Hh-producing cells. A key issue in Hh signaling is to understand the molecular mechanisms by which lipid-modified Hh protein is transported from its sites of synthesis and subsequently moves through the morphogenetic field. The dispatched gene, which encodes a putative multipass membrane protein, was initially identified in Drosophila and is required in Hh-producing cells, where it facilitates the transport of cholesterol-modified Hh. We report the identification of the mouse dispatched (Disp) gene and a phenotypic analysis of Disp mutant mice. Disp-null mice phenocopy mice deficient in the smoothened gene, an essential component for Hh reception, suggesting that Disp is essential for Hh signaling. This conclusion was further supported by a detailed molecular analysis of Disp knockout mice, which exhibit defects characteristic of loss of Hh signaling. We also provide evidence that Disp is not required for Hh protein synthesis or processing, but rather for the movement of Hh protein from its sites of synthesis in mice.

Shh-induced capillary morphogenesis was also blocked by LY294002, a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) inhibitor. Shh rapidly increased PI3-kinase activity in IBE cells and HUVECs; this activity was inhibited by cyclopamine. Nuclear localization of Gli1 was increased in Shh-treated IBE cells, which was not affected by LY294002. Actinomycin D and cycloheximide inhibited Shh-induced capillary morphogenesis. In IBE cells expressing kinase-inactive c-Fes, Shh failed to stimulate PI3-kinase activity and capillary morphogenesis. Considered collectively, Shh induced capillary morphogenesis of endothelial cells through both rapid activation of c-Fes/PI3-kinase pathways and transcriptionally regulated pathways.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"12533514","pmcid":null,"title":"Tbx1 is regulated by tissue-specific forkhead proteins through a common Sonic hedgehog-responsive enhancer.","authors":["Yamagishi H","Maeda J","Hu T","McAnally J","Conway SJ","Kume T","Meyers EN","Yamagishi C","Srivastava D"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Genes & development","journalShort":"Genes Dev.","day":15,"month":1,"year":2003,"meshHeadings":["Animals","DNA-Binding Proteins","DiGeorge Syndrome","Disease Models, Animal","Enhancer Elements, Genetic","Forkhead Transcription Factors","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Hedgehog Proteins","Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 3-beta","Humans","Mice","Mice, Knockout","Mice, Mutant Strains","Mice, Transgenic","Models, Biological","Nuclear Proteins","Organ Specificity","Signal Transduction","T-Box Domain Proteins","Trans-Activators","Transcription Factors"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Haploinsufficiency of Tbx1 is likely a major determinant of cardiac and craniofacial birth defects associated with DiGeorge syndrome. Although mice deficient in Tbx1 exhibit pharyngeal and aortic arch defects, the developmental program and mechanisms through which Tbx1 functions are relatively unknown. We identified a single cis-element upstream of Tbx1 that recognized winged helix/forkhead box (Fox)-containing transcription factors and was essential for regulation of Tbx1 transcription in the pharyngeal endoderm and head mesenchyme. The Tbx1 regulatory region was responsive to signaling by Sonic hedgehog (Shh) in vivo. We show that Shh is necessary for aortic arch development, similar to Tbx1, and is also required for expression of Foxa2 and Foxc2 in the pharyngeal endoderm and head mesenchyme, respectively. Foxa2, Foxc1, or Foxc2 could bind and activate transcription through the critical cis-element upstream of Tbx1, and Foxc proteins were required, within their expression domains, for Tbx1 transcription in vivo.

In contrast to the more compartmentalized developmental organization of the spinal cord, the generation of neurons and OLs from a common ventral forebrain stem cell would expose these cells to the sequential actions of ventral and dorsal gradient morphogens [sonic hedgehog (Shh) and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs)] that normally mediate opposing developmental programs. Here we report that Shh promotes GABAergic neuronalOL lineage restriction of forebrain stem cells, in part, by activation of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, Olig2 and Mash1. In mutant mice with a generalized defect in tangential cortical migration (Dlx12--), there is a profound and selective reduction in the elaboration of both cortical GABAergic neurons and OLs. Our studies further demonstrate that the sequential elaboration of cortical GABAergic neurons and OLs from common Shh-responsive ventral forebrain progenitors requires the spatial and temporal modulation of cortical BMP signaling by BMP ligands and the BMP antagonist, noggin, respectively. These findings suggest an integrative model for cerebral cortical GABAergic neuronal and OL lineage maturation that would incorporate the sequential contributions of the ventral and dorsal forebrain, and the potential role of regional developmental cues in modulating transcriptional codes within evolving neural lineage species.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"12466851","pmcid":null,"title":"Analysis of the mouse transcriptome based on functional annotation of 60,770 full-length cDNAs.","authors":["Okazaki Y","Furuno M","Kasukawa T","Adachi J","Bono H","Kondo S","Nikaido I","Osato N","Saito R","Suzuki H","Yamanaka I","Kiyosawa H","Yagi K","Tomaru Y","Hasegawa Y","Nogami A","Schönbach C","Gojobori T","Baldarelli R","Hill DP","Bult C","Hume DA","Quackenbush J","Schriml LM","Kanapin A","Matsuda H","Batalov S","Beisel KW","Blake JA","Bradt D","Brusic V","Chothia C","Corbani LE","Cousins S","Dalla E","Dragani TA","Fletcher CF","Forrest A","Frazer KS","Gaasterland T","Gariboldi M","Gissi C","Godzik A","Gough J","Grimmond S","Gustincich S","Hirokawa N","Jackson IJ","Jarvis ED","Kanai A","Kawaji H","Kawasawa Y","Kedzierski RM","King BL","Konagaya A","Kurochkin IV","Lee Y","Lenhard B","Lyons PA","Maglott DR","Maltais L","Marchionni L","McKenzie L","Miki H","Nagashima T","Numata K","Okido T","Pavan WJ","Pertea G","Pesole G","Petrovsky N","Pillai R","Pontius JU","Qi D","Ramachandran S","Ravasi T","Reed JC","Reed DJ","Reid J","Ring BZ","Ringwald M","Sandelin A","Schneider C","Semple CA","Setou M","Shimada K","Sultana R","Takenaka Y","Taylor MS","Teasdale RD","Tomita M","Verardo R","Wagner L","Wahlestedt C","Wang Y","Watanabe Y","Wells C","Wilming LG","Wynshaw-Boris A","Yanagisawa M","Yang I","Yang L","Yuan Z","Zavolan M","Zhu Y","Zimmer A","Carninci P","Hayatsu N","Hirozane-Kishikawa T","Konno H","Nakamura M","Sakazume N","Sato K","Shiraki T","Waki K","Kawai J","Aizawa K","Arakawa T","Fukuda S","Hara A","Hashizume W","Imotani K","Ishii Y","Itoh M","Kagawa I","Miyazaki A","Sakai K","Sasaki D","Shibata K","Shinagawa A","Yasunishi A","Yoshino M","Waterston R","Lander ES","Rogers J","Birney E","Hayashizaki Y","FANTOM Consortium","RIKEN Genome Exploration Research Group Phase I & II Team"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Nature","journalShort":"Nature","day":5,"month":12,"year":2002,"meshHeadings":["Alternative Splicing","Amino Acid Motifs","Animals","Chromosomes, Mammalian","Cloning, Molecular","DNA, Complementary","Databases, Genetic","Expressed Sequence Tags","Genes","Genomics","Humans","Membrane Proteins","Mice","Physical Chromosome Mapping","Protein Structure, Tertiary","Proteome","RNA, Antisense","RNA, Messenger","RNA, Untranslated","Transcription Initiation Site","Transcription, Genetic"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Only a small proportion of the mouse genome is transcribed into mature messenger RNA transcripts.

Of the three Gli transcription factors involved in transducing Shh signals in vertebrates, we demonstrate here that Gli2 is the key mediator of Shh responses in skin. Similar to Shh(-/-) mice, Gli2(-/-) mutants exhibit an arrest in hair follicle development with reduced cell proliferation and Shh-responsive gene expression, but grossly normal epidermal differentiation. By transgenic rescue experiments, we show that epidermal Gli2 function alone is sufficient to restore hair follicle development in Gli2(-/-) skin. Furthermore, only a constitutively active form of Gli2, but not wild-type Gli2, can activate Shh-responsive gene expression and promote cell proliferation in Shh(-/-) skin. These observations indicate that Shh-dependent Gli2 activator function in the epidermis is essential for hair follicle development. Our data also reveal that Gli2 mediates the mitogenic effects of Shh by transcriptional activation of cyclin D1 and cyclin D2 in the developing hair follicles. Together, our results suggest that Shh-dependent Gli2 activation plays a critical role in epithelial homeostasis by promoting proliferation through the transcriptional control of cell cycle regulators.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"12571105","pmcid":null,"title":"Sox5 and Sox6 are required for notochord extracellular matrix sheath formation, notochord cell survival and development of the nucleus pulposus of intervertebral discs.","authors":["Smits P","Lefebvre V"],"grantIds":["AR46249"],"grantAgencies":["NIAMS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":6,"month":3,"year":2003,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Cell Differentiation","Cell Survival","Chondrocytes","DNA-Binding Proteins","High Mobility Group Proteins","Intervertebral Disc","Mice","Notochord","Nuclear Proteins","SOXD Transcription Factors","Transcription Factors"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"The notochord has major roles in vertebral column formation: indirectly by inducing sclerotome cell differentiation; and directly by forming the nucleus pulposus of intervertebral discs. Sox5 and Sox6 encode Sry-related HMG box transcription factors that act redundantly to promote chondroblast differentiation in all cartilages of the mouse embryo. We show that Sox5 and Sox6 are expressed in the notochord cell lineage and required for notochord late development. In Sox5(-/-)/Sox6(-/-) embryos, the notochord formed a typical rod-like structure. It fulfilled its inductive functions, as indicated by expression of sonic hedgehog and sclerotome specification. However, the notochord failed to become surrounded with an extracellular matrix sheath. This phenotype was associated with a downregulation of extracellular matrix genes, including the genes for collagen 2, aggrecan and perlecan in both notochord cells and surrounding chondrocytic cells of presumptive inner annuli and vertebral bodies. The mutant notochord then underwent an aberrant, fatal dismantling after sclerotome cell migration. Its cells became removed first from intervertebral spaces and then from vertebral bodies, and it progressively underwent apoptosis. Meanwhile, the development of inner annuli and vertebral bodies was dramatically impaired. Consequently, the vertebral column of Sox5(-/-)/Sox6(-/-) fetuses consisted of a very deficient cartilage and was devoid of nuclei pulposi. In Sox5(-/-)/Sox6(+/-) and more severely in Sox5(+/-)/Sox6(-/-) embryos, the notochord sheath was thinner, but cells survived. By birth, nuclei pulposi were rudimentary, and its cells poorly swelled and still expressing sonic hedgehog. Hence, Sox5 and Sox6 are required for notochord extracellular matrix sheath formation, notochord cell survival and formation of nuclei pulposi. Through these roles and essential roles in cartilage formation, they are central transcriptional regulators of vertebral column development.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"12544841","pmcid":null,"title":"Strain-specific caspase-3-dependent programmed cell death in the early developing mouse forebrain.","authors":["Momoi T","Fujita E","Urase K"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Neuroreport","journalShort":"Neuroreport","day":20,"month":1,"year":2003,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Apoptosis","Biological Markers","Caspase 3","Caspases","Fibroblast Growth Factor 8","Fibroblast Growth Factors","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Hedgehog Proteins","Homeodomain Proteins","Hyperplasia","In Situ Nick-End Labeling","Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Mice, Inbred Strains","Morphogenesis","Nerve Tissue Proteins","Otx Transcription Factors","Prosencephalon","Proteins","Species Specificity","Trans-Activators","Transcription Factors"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Caspase-3-deficient 129/Sv mice show hyperplasia of the forebrain at embryonic day (E) 10.5, which suggests that caspase-3-dependent programmed cell death (PCD) plays an essential role in brain morphogenesis prior to neurogenesis.

We examined the PCD region in the early developmental brain at E9.5 by whole mount terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling (TUNEL). In addition to hindbrain, TUNEL-reactivity was detected in the ventral forebrain and in the caudal portion of the front nasal region, just behind the regions expressing fgf-8 and otx-2.

One of these, the apical ectodermal ridge (AER), is critical for proximodistal limb outgrowth mediated by FGFs. Signals from the underlying mesoderm, including WNTs and FGFs, regulate early steps of AER induction. Ectodermal factors, particularly En1, play a critical role in regulating morphogenesis of a mature, compact AER along the distal limb apex, from a broad ventral ectodermal precursor domain. Contribution of mesodermal factors to the morphogenesis of a mature AER is less clear. We previously noted that the chick T gene (Brachyury), the prototypical T-box transcription factor, is expressed in the limb bud as well as axial mesoderm and primitive streak. Here we show that T is expressed in lateral plate mesoderm at the onset of limb bud formation and subsequently in the subridge mesoderm beneath the AER. Retroviral misexpression of T in chick results in anterior extension of the AER and subsequent limb phenotypes consistent with augmented AER extent and function. Analysis of markers for functional AER in mouse T(-/-) null mutant limb buds reveals disrupted AER morphogenesis. Our data also suggest that FGF and WNT signals may operate both upstream and downstream of T. Taken together, the results show that T plays a role in the regulation of AER formation, particularly maturation, and suggest that T may also be a component of the epithelialmesenchymal regulatory loop involved in maintenance of a mature functioning AER.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"12569124","pmcid":null,"title":"Feedback control of mammalian Hedgehog signaling by the Hedgehog-binding protein, Hip1, modulates Fgf signaling during branching morphogenesis of the lung.","authors":["Chuang PT","Kawcak T","McMahon AP"],"grantIds":["DK 56246","HL67822","NS 33642"],"grantAgencies":["NIDDK NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NINDS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Genes & development","journalShort":"Genes Dev.","day":1,"month":2,"year":2003,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Carrier Proteins","Feedback","Fibroblast Growth Factors","Hedgehog Proteins","Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins","Lung","Membrane Glycoproteins","Membrane Proteins","Mice","Receptors, Cell Surface","Signal Transduction","Trans-Activators","Up-Regulation"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Hedgehog (Hh) signaling plays a major role in multiple aspects of embryonic development.

The authors aimed to study the temporal and spatial pattern of expression of Shh and its receptor Ptc1 during the development of the anterior foregut and to test the hypothesis that the Shh expression pattern is disturbed during the development of oesophageal atresia (OA) and tracheo-oesophageal fistula (TOF) in Adriamycin-treated mouse embryos. METHODS: Saline and Adriamycin-treated (4 mg/kg) CBA/Ca embryos were harvested between embryonic days (E) 10.5 and 12.5, and Shh and Ptc1 expression was studied by whole-mount and section in situ hybridisation using digoxygenin-labelled riboprobes. RESULTS: At E10.5, saline-treated embryos had an undivided foregut in which the ventrally placed prospective tracheal epithelium was positive for Shh, whereas the dorsal part was negative. At E11.5, this pattern had reversed with the separated trachea becoming negative and the oesophagus gaining expression of Shh. Ptc1 was expressed in the mesoderm adjacent to Shh expressing endoderm at both stages. Affected Adriamycin-treated embryos had an undivided foregut at E11.5, the epithelium of which showed diffuse Shh staining that lacked the dorso-ventral patterning seen in controls. CONCLUSIONS: The reversal in the dorso-ventral pattern of Shh expression during the narrow embryologic window in which tracheo-oesophageal separation is initiated suggests that Shh may play an important role in this process. Transient disturbance of this pattern may underlie the abnormal organogenesis in the Adriamycin model.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"12648495","pmcid":null,"title":"Doubleridge, a mouse mutant with defective compaction of the apical ectodermal ridge and normal dorsal-ventral patterning of the limb.","authors":["Adamska M","MacDonald BT","Meisler MH"],"grantIds":["GM 24872","T32 GM07544"],"grantAgencies":["NIGMS NIH HHS","NIGMS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Developmental biology","journalShort":"Dev.

In organotypic cultures of developing rat prostates, Shh inhibited cell proliferation and promoted differentiation of luminal epithelial cells. The expression pattern of Shh and its receptors suggests a paracrine mechanism of action. The Shh receptors Ptc1 (Patched1) and Ptc2 were found to be expressed in prostatic stromal cells adjacent to the epithelium, where Shh itself was produced. This paracrine model was confirmed by co-culturing the developing prostate in the presence of stromal cells transfected with a vector expressing a constitutively active form of Smoothened, the real effector of the Shh signaling pathway. Furthermore, expression of activin A and TGF-beta1 that were shown previously to inhibit prostatic epithelial branching was up-regulated following Shh treatment in the organotypic cultures.

We show here that BMP4 is not expressed in the early tongue, but is precisely coexpressed with Shh in papillary placodes, which serve as a signaling center for both gustatory and papillary development. To elucidate the role of Shh, we used an in vitro model of mouse fungiform papillary development to determine the effects of two functional inhibitors of Shh signaling: anti-Shh (5E1) antibody and cyclopamine. Cultured E11.5 tongue explants express Shh and BMP4(LacZ) in a pattern similar to that of intact embryos, localizing to developing papillary placodes after 2 days in culture. Tongues cultured with 5E1 antibody continue to express these genes in papillary patterns but develop more papillae that are larger and closer together than in controls. Tongues cultured with cyclopamine have a dose-dependent expansion of Shh and BMP4(LacZ) expression domains. Both antibody-treated and cyclopamine-treated tongue explants also are smaller than controls.

These specified cells give rise to the precursors of the endocrine, ductal, and exocrine pancreatic cells. The identification of transcription factors that regulate the onset of Pdx-1 expression is therefore essential to understand pancreas development. No such factor that acts both in the ventral and in the dorsal endoderm is known. We showed previously that the Onecut transcription factor HNF-6 promotes differentiation of the endocrine cell precursors in which it stimulates expression of the proendocrine gene Ngn-3. By analyzing the phenotype of HNF-6 null mice, we now demonstrate that HNF-6 also controls an earlier step in pancreas development. Indeed, the pancreas of Hnf6(-/-) mice was hypoplastic. This did not result from decreased proliferation or from increased apoptosis, but from retarded pancreatic specification of endodermal cells. The onset of Pdx-1 expression was delayed both in the ventral and in the dorsal endoderm, leading to a reduction in the number of endodermal cells expressing Pdx-1 at the time of pancreatic budding. In normal embryos, HNF-6 was detected in the endoderm prior to the expression of Pdx-1. Moreover, HNF-6 could directly stimulate the Pdx1 promoter. Our data therefore identify HNF-6 as the first factor known to control Pdx-1 expression both in the ventral and in the dorsal endoderm. We conclude that HNF-6 controls the timing of pancreas specification and that HNF-6 acts upstream of Pdx-1 in this developmental process. Together with the known role of HNF-6 in pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation, our data point to HNF-6 as a key regulator of pancreas development.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"12679031","pmcid":null,"title":"The morphogen sonic hedgehog is an axonal chemoattractant that collaborates with netrin-1 in midline axon guidance.","authors":["Charron F","Stein E","Jeong J","McMahon AP","Tessier-Lavigne M"],"grantIds":["NS 33642"],"grantAgencies":["NINDS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Cell","journalShort":"Cell","day":4,"month":4,"year":2003,"meshHeadings":["Animals","COS Cells","Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal","Cell Communication","Cell Differentiation","Chemotaxis","Contactin 2","Fetus","Growth Cones","Hedgehog Proteins","Integrases","Mice","Mice, Mutant Strains","Nerve Growth Factors","Proto-Oncogene Proteins","Rats","Receptors, Cell Surface","Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled","Spinal Cord","Trans-Activators","Tumor Suppressor Proteins","Veratrum Alkaloids","Viral Proteins","Wnt Proteins","Xenopus laevis","Zebrafish Proteins"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Developing axons are guided to their targets by attractive and repulsive guidance cues.

We used DNA microarrays to identify targets of Shh in these cells and found that Shh activates a program of transcription that promotes cell cycle entry and DNA replication. Among the genes most robustly induced by Shh are cyclin D1 and N-myc. N-myc transcription is induced in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, so it appears to be a direct target of Shh. Retroviral transduction of N-myc into GCPs induces expression of cyclin D1, E2F1, and E2F2, and promotes proliferation. Moreover, dominant-negative N-myc substantially reduces Shh-induced proliferation, indicating that N-myc is required for the Shh response. Finally, cyclin D1 and N-myc are overexpressed in murine medulloblastoma.

However, at late gestation stages, there is no discernible difference in the steady-state number of OLPs between the wild type and mutants.

In males, one of the most common GU malformations associated with loss of Hoxa13 function is hypospadia, a condition defined by the poor growth and closure of the urethra and glans penis. By examining early signaling in the developing mouse genital tubercle, we show that Hoxa13 is essential for normal expression of Fgf8 and Bmp7 in the urethral plate epithelium. In Hoxa13(GFP)-mutant mice, hypospadias occur as a result of the combined loss of Fgf8 and Bmp7 expression in the urethral plate epithelium, as well as the ectopic expression of noggin (Nog) in the flanking mesenchyme. In vitro supplementation with Fgf8 restored proliferation in homozygous mutants to wild-type levels, suggesting that Fgf8 is sufficient to direct early proliferation of the developing genital tubercle. However, the closure defects of the distal urethra and glans can be attributed to a loss of apoptosis in the urethra, which is consistent with reduced Bmp7 expression in this region. Mice mutant for Hoxa13 also exhibit changes in androgen receptor expression, providing a developmental link between Hoxa13-associated hypospadias and those produced by antagonists to androgen signaling.

Here, we show that the chromosome 7q36 associated preaxial polydactyly, a frequently observed congenital limb malformation, results from point mutations in a Shh regulatory element. Shh, normally expressed in the ZPA posteriorly in the limb bud, is expressed in an additional ectopic site at the anterior margin in mouse models of PPD. Our investigations into the basis of the ectopic Shh expression identified the enhancer element that drives normal Shh expression in the ZPA. The regulator, designated ZRS, lies within intron 5 of the Lmbr1 gene 1 Mb from the target gene Shh. The ZRS drives the early spatio-temporal expression pattern in the limb of tetrapods. Despite the morphological differences between limbs and fins, an equivalent regulatory element is found in fish. The ZRS contains point mutations that segregate with polydactyly in four unrelated families with PPD and in the Hx mouse mutant. Thus point mutations residing in long-range regulatory elements are capable of causing congenital abnormalities, and possess the capacity to modify gene activity such that a novel gamut of abnormalities is detected.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"12808099","pmcid":null,"title":"The murine Nck SH2/SH3 adaptors are important for the development of mesoderm-derived embryonic structures and for regulating the cellular actin network.","authors":["Bladt F","Aippersbach E","Gelkop S","Strasser GA","Nash P","Tafuri A","Gertler FB","Pawson T"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Molecular and cellular biology","journalShort":"Mol.

Previous studies suggest that signaling pathways activated by Nodal, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), and Wnt ligands coordinately regulate patterning of the streak and the formation of midline organizing tissues, but the specific contributions of these molecules within discrete cell lineages are poorly defined. Here we removed Smad2 activity in the epiblast, using a conditional inactivation strategy. Abrogation of Smad2 does not compromise primitive streak (PS) formation or gastrulation movements, but rather results in a failure to correctly specify the anterior definitive endoderm (ADE) and prechordal plate (PCP) progenitors. To selectively lower Nodal activity in the posterior epiblast, we generated a novel allele lacking the proximal epiblast enhancer (PEE) governing Nodal expression in the PS. As for conditional inactivation of Smad2, germ-line deletion of the PEE selectively disrupts development of the anterior streak. In striking contrast, the node and its midline derivatives, the notochord and floor plate, develop normally in both categories of mutant embryos. Finally, we show that removal of one copy of Smad3 in the context of a Smad2-deficient epiblast results in a failure to specify all axial midline tissues. These findings conclusively demonstrate that graded Nodal/Smad2 signals govern allocation of the axial mesendoderm precursors that selectively give rise to the ADE and PCP mesoderm.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"12839624","pmcid":null,"title":"The receptor tyrosine kinase Ror2 is involved in non-canonical Wnt5a/JNK signalling pathway.","authors":["Oishi I","Suzuki H","Onishi N","Takada R","Kani S","Ohkawara B","Koshida I","Suzuki K","Yamada G","Schwabe GC","Mundlos S","Shibuya H","Takada S","Minami Y"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms","journalShort":"Genes Cells","day":3,"month":7,"year":2003,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Blotting, Western","Enzyme Activation","JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases","MAP Kinase Kinase 4","Mice","Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases","Phenotype","Precipitin Tests","Proto-Oncogene Proteins","Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases","Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors","Signal Transduction","Wnt Proteins"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"BACKGROUND: Ror2 is an orphan receptor, belonging to the Ror family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Although Ror2 has been shown to play crucial roles in developmental morphogenesis, the precise signalling events that Ror2 mediates remain elusive. Since Ror2 possesses an extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD) that resembles the Wnt-binding sites of the Frizzled (Fz) proteins, it is conceivable that Ror2 interacts with members of the Wnt family. RESULTS: Both Ror2-/- and Wnt5a-/- mice exhibit dwarfism, facial abnormalities, short limbs and tails, dysplasia of lungs and genitals, and ventricular septal defects. In vitro binding assay revealed that Wnt5a binds to the CRD of Ror2. Furthermore, Ror2 associates via its CRD with rFz2, a putative receptor for Wnt5a. Interestingly, Wnt5a and Ror2 activate the non-canonical Wnt pathway, as assessed by activation of JNK in cultured cells and inhibition of convergent extension movements in Xenopus.

The presumed cells-of-origin are undifferentiated precursors of granule neurons that occupy the external granule layer (EGL) of the developing cerebellum. The overexpression of proteins that normally stimulate proliferation of neural progenitor cells may initiate medulloblastoma formation. Two known mitogens for neural progenitors are the c-Myc oncoprotein and Sonic hedgehog (Shh), a crucial determinant of embryonic pattern formation in the central nervous system. We modeled the ability of c-Myc and Shh to induce medulloblastoma in mice using the RCAS/tv-a system, which allows postnatal gene transfer and expression in a cell type-specific manner. We targeted the expression of Shh and c-Myc to nestin-expressing neural progenitor cells by injecting replication-competent ALV splice acceptor (RCAS) vectors into the cerebella of newborn mice. Following injection with RCAS-Shh alone, 3/32 (9%) mice developed medulloblastomas and 5/32 showed multifocal hyperproliferation of the EGL, possibly a precursor stage of medulloblastoma. Following injection with RCAS-Shh plus RCAS-Myc, 9/39 (23%) mice developed medulloblastomas.

This results in the generation of a secondary proliferative population and the appearance of a second germinal layer, the subventricular zone (SVZ). We have shown previously that bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) act antagonistically to regulate the development of a subset of SVZ progenitors that normally express a high level of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors and divide in response to EGF. In the present study, we show that Wnt 7a, Wnt 7b, and Sonic hedgehog (Shh) promote progenitor maturation in explant cultures, as reported for FGF2. Wnts 7a and 7b also stimulate the proliferation of neurogenic progenitors and increase the number of cells that can generate primary neurospheres. To determine whether Wnts, FGF2, and Shh act independently or in a common pathway, each factor was inhibited in cortical explants. This revealed that endogenous Wnts, FGF2, and Shh normally contribute to progenitor maturation. Moreover, Wnt 7a depends on FGF2 or Shh to promote maturation but not proliferation. Maturation induced by blocking BMPs also depends on Shh. In contrast, FGF2 promotes maturation by a Shh-independent mechanism. In vivo, progenitors infected with a Wnt 7a retrovirus at E10.5 were found preferentially in the SVZ at E16.5. These findings suggest that Wnts depend on Shh or FGF2 to promote progenitor maturation to an SVZ state in the embryonic cortex.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"12917333","pmcid":null,"title":"Identification of novel roles of the cytochrome p450 system in early embryogenesis: effects on vasculogenesis and retinoic Acid homeostasis.","authors":["Otto DM","Henderson CJ","Carrie D","Davey M","Gundersen TE","Blomhoff R","Adams RH","Tickle C","Wolf CR"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Molecular and cellular biology","journalShort":"Mol.

In order to establish the role of these enzymes in embryogenesis, we have inactivated the system through the deletion of the gene for the electron donor to all microsomal P450 proteins, cytochrome P450 reductase (Cpr). Mouse embryos homozygous for this deletion died in early to middle gestation (approximately 9.5 days postcoitum [dpc]) and exhibited a number of novel phenotypes, including the severe inhibition of vasculogenesis and hematopoiesis. In addition, defects in the brain, limbs, and cell types where CPR was shown to be expressed were observed. Some of the observed abnormalities have been associated with perturbations in retinoic acid homeostasis in later embryogenesis. Consistent with this possibility, embryos at 9.5 dpc had significantly elevated levels of retinoic acid and reduced levels of retinol. Further, some of the observed phenotypes could be either reversed or exacerbated by decreasing or increasing maternal retinoic acid exposure, respectively. Detailed analysis demonstrated a close relationship between the observed phenotype and the expression of genes controlling vasculogenesis. These data demonstrate that the cytochrome P450 system plays a key role in early embryonic development; this process appears to be, at least in part, controlled by regional concentrations of retinoic acid and has profound effects on blood vessel formation.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"12860919","pmcid":null,"title":"Postnatal recapitulation of embryonic hedgehog pathway in response to skeletal muscle ischemia.","authors":["Pola R","Ling LE","Aprahamian TR","Barban E","Bosch-Marce M","Curry C","Corbley M","Kearney M","Isner JM","Losordo DW"],"grantIds":["AG-16332","HL-53354","HL-57516","HL-60911","HL-63414","HL-63695","HL-66957"],"grantAgencies":["NIA NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Circulation","journalShort":"Circulation","day":29,"month":7,"year":2003,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Antibodies, Blocking","Blotting, Western","Disease Models, Animal","Endothelial Growth Factors","Female","Hedgehog Proteins","Hindlimb","Immunohistochemistry","Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins","Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins","Ischemia","Lymphokines","Male","Membrane Proteins","Mesoderm","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Mice, Transgenic","Muscle, Skeletal","Neovascularization, Physiologic","RNA, Messenger","Receptors, Cell Surface","Signal Transduction","Trans-Activators","Up-Regulation","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A","Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"BACKGROUND: Hedgehog (Hh) proteins are morphogens regulating epithelial-mesenchymal signaling during several crucial processes of embryonic development, including muscle patterning. Sonic (Shh), Indian (Ihh), and Desert (Dhh) hedgehog constitute the repertoire of Hh genes in humans. The activities of all 3 are transduced via the Patched (Ptc1) receptor. Recent observations indicate that exogenous administration of Shh induces angiogenesis. Here, we studied whether the endogenous Hh pathway, in addition to its functions during embryogenesis, plays a physiological role in muscle regeneration after ischemia in adults. METHODS AND RESULTS: We found that skeletal muscle ischemia induces strong local upregulation of Shh mRNA and protein. In addition, the Ptc1 receptor is activated in interstitial mesenchymal cells within the ischemic area, indicating that these cells respond to Shh and that the Shh pathway is functional. We also found that Shh-responding cells produce vascular endothelial growth factor under ischemic conditions and that systemic treatment with a Shh-blocking antibody inhibits the local angiogenic response and the upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the Hh signaling may be recapitulated postnatally in adult and fully differentiated muscular tissues and has a regulatory role on angiogenesis during muscle regeneration after ischemia.

A subset of embryos also show a shortening of the anterior-posterior axis and frequent duplication of axial structures that are strikingly similar to the phenotypes associated with axin deficiency, a critical regulator of Wnt signaling. Loss of LPP3 results in a marked increase in beta-catenin-mediated TCF transcription, whereas elevated levels of LPP3 inhibit beta-catenin-mediated TCF transcription.

Chimeras with a high proportion of mutant cells did not form limbs, whereas those with a moderate proportion formed limb buds with a lobular structure and a discontinuous AER.

Although much progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms underlying the specification of dorsal and ventral structures, little is known about the specification of the paleocortex, the olfactory cortex located at the interface of the dorsal and ventral telencephalon. The paleocortex is thought to be a dorsal, cortical structure, derived from the lateral extreme of the dorsal telencephalon. We examined mutant mice in which dorsal telencephalic patterning is severely disrupted, to ask how these perturbations affect the paleocortex. In the Lhx2-/- telencephalon, where the cortex is greatly shrunken such that medial and dorsal cortical tissue is undetectable, normal expression of several paleocortical markers is observed. The Gli3-/- telencephalon, where the dorsal telencephalon is ventralized, also displays paleocortical markers. In contrast, when the ventral telencephalon is almost completely deleted, such as in the BF1-/- brain, paleocortical markers are undetectable. These results indicate that the specification of the paleocortex can occur in spite of drastic perturbations of dorsal patterning. Furthermore, in the Lhx2 mutant, the paleocortex is juxtaposed to an expanded and mislocated source of Wnt and Bmp signaling, the cortical hem, whereas, in the Gli3 mutant, paleocortical markers arise even though the cortical hem is missing. This indicates that an increase or decrease in cues from this dorsal signaling center does not disrupt the specification of the paleocortex. Finally, by using an in vitro assay, we found that isolated explants of lateral telencephalon up-regulate normal expression of paleocortical markers when maintained in vitro, from as early as embryonic day (E) 10.5. Together, the results reveal that, although the paleocortex is considered to be a cortical structure, it is specified even when dorsal telencephalic patterning is grossly perturbed. Furthermore, our in vitro data reveal that, if mechanisms outside the lateral telencephalon are involved in the specification of the paleocortex, they must act extremely early, prior to E10.5.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"14516668","pmcid":null,"title":"Efficient gene modulation in mouse epiblast using a Sox2Cre transgenic mouse strain.","authors":["Hayashi S","Lewis P","Pevny L","McMahon AP"],"grantIds":["DK54364","HD30249","NS33642"],"grantAgencies":["NIDDK NIH HHS","NICHD NIH HHS","NINDS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Mechanisms of development","journalShort":"Mech.

The precise role of this cascade in osteoblast differentiation was examined. We show that a Wnt autocrine loop mediates the induction of alkaline phosphatase and mineralization by BMP-2 in pre-osteoblastic cells. INTRODUCTION: Loss of function of LRP5 leads to osteoporosis (OPPG syndrome), and a specific point mutation in this same receptor results in high bone mass (HBM). Because LRP5 acts as a coreceptor for Wnt proteins, these findings suggest a crucial role for Wnt signaling in bone biology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have investigated the involvement of the Wnt/LRP5 cascade in osteoblast function by using the pluripotent mesenchymal cell lines C3H10T1/2, C2C12, and ST2 and the osteoblast cell line MC3T3-E1. Transfection experiments were carried out with a number of elements of the Wnt/LRP5 pathway. Measuring osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation markers addressed the effect of this cascade on osteoblast differentiation. RESULTS: In mesenchymal cells, only Wnt's capable of stabilizing beta-catenin induced the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Wnt3a-mediated ALP induction was inhibited by overexpression of either Xddl, dickkopf 1 (dkk1), or LRP5deltaC, indicating that canonical beta-catenin signaling is responsible for this activity. The use of Noggin, a bone morphogenic protein (BMP) inhibitor, or cyclopamine, a Hedgehog inhibitor, revealed that the induction of ALP by Wnt is independent of these morphogenetic proteins and does not require de novo protein synthesis. In contrast, blocking Wnt/LRP5 signaling or protein synthesis inhibited the ability of both BMP-2 and Shh to induce ALP in mesenchymal cells. Moreover, BMP-2 enhanced Wntl and Wnt3a expression in our cells. In MC3T3-E1 cells, where endogenous ALP levels are maximal, antagonizing the Wnt/LRP5 pathway led to a decrease of ALP activity. In addition, overexpression of dkkl reduced extracellular matrix mineralization in a BMP-2-dependent assay. CONCLUSIONS: Our data strongly suggest that the capacity of BMP-2 and Shh to induce ALP relies on Wnt expression and the Wnt/LRP5 signaling cascade. Moreover the effects of BMP-2 on extracellular matrix mineralization by osteoblasts are mediated, at least in part, by the induction of a Wnt autocrine/paracrine loop. These results may help to explain the phenotype of OPPG patients and HBM.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"14567981","pmcid":null,"title":"Morphological evidence of the importance of epithelial tissue during mouse tongue development.","authors":["Kim JY","Mochizuki T","Akita K","Jung HS"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Experimental cell research","journalShort":"Exp.

Prior to the morphological changes, the Bmp-4 and Shh transcripts are expressed in a restricted area on the dorsal surface.

From the recombination assay results, the E13.5 epithelial portion of the fungiform papillae could determine the position of the newly formed fungiform papillae with the epithelial signaling molecules.

Although at term the epidermis of Fgfr2-IIIb null mice is only two to three cells thick, it expresses the classical markers of epidermal differentiation and establishes a functional barrier. Mice deficient for Fgf10 display a similar but less severe epidermal hypoplasia. By contrast, Fgfr2-IIIb-/-, but not Fgf10-/-, mice produced significantly fewer hair follicles, and their follicles were developmentally retarded.

Positioning of the future anterior-posterior axis of the embryo occurs through coordinated cell movements that rotate a pre-existing proximal-distal (P-D) axis. Overt axis formation becomes evident when a discrete population of proximal epiblast cells become induced to form mesoderm, initiating primitive streak formation and marking the posterior side of the embryo. Over the next 12-24 h the primitive streak gradually elongates along the posterior side of the epiblast to reach the distal tip. The most anterior streak cells comprise the 'organizer' region and include the precursors of the so-called 'axial mesendoderm', namely the anterior definitive endoderm and prechordal plate mesoderm, as well as those cells that give rise to the morphologically patent node. Signalling pathways controlled by the transforming growth factor-beta ligand nodal are involved in orchestrating the process of axis formation. Embryos lacking nodal activity arrest development before gastrulation, reflecting an essential role for nodal in establishing P-D polarity by generating and maintaining the molecular pattern within the epiblast, extraembryonic ectoderm and the visceral endoderm.

While the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is required for hair follicle morphogenesis, the role of this pathway during embryonic mammary gland development remains undetermined. We demonstrate here that, unlike the hair follicle, both Shh and Ihh are expressed in the developing embryonic mouse mammary rudiment as early as E12.5. In Shh(-/-) embryos, hair follicle development becomes arrested at an early stage, while the mammary rudiment, which continues to express Ihh, develops in a manner indistinguishable from that of wild-type littermates. The five pairs of mammary buds in Shh(-/-) female embryos exhibit normal branching morphogenesis at E16.5, forming a rudimentary ductal structure identical to wild-type embryonic mammary glands. We further demonstrate that loss of Hh signaling causes altered cyclin D1 expression in the embryonic dermal mesenchyme. Specifically, cyclin D1 is expressed at E14.5 principally in the condensed mesenchymal cells of the presumptive hair follicles and in both mesenchymal and epithelial cells of the mammary rudiments in wild-type and Shh-deficient embryos. By E18.5, robust cyclin D1 expression is maintained in mammary rudiments of both wild-type and Shh-deficient embryos. In hair follicles of wild-type embryos by E18.5, cyclin D1 expression switches to follicular epithelial cells. In contrast, strong cyclin D1 expression is observed principally in the mesenchymal cells of arrested hair follicles in Shh(-/-) embryos at E18.5. These data reveal that, despite the common embryonic origin of hair follicles and mammary glands, distinct patterns of Hh-family expression occur in these two tissues. Furthermore, these data suggest that cyclin D1 expression in the embryonic hair follicle is mediated by both Hh-independent and Hh-dependent mechanisms.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"14633591","pmcid":null,"title":"Hedgehog signaling regulates sebaceous gland development.","authors":["Allen M","Grachtchouk M","Sheng H","Grachtchouk V","Wang A","Wei L","Liu J","Ramirez A","Metzger D","Chambon P","Jorcano J","Dlugosz AA"],"grantIds":["AR45973","CA46592","CA87837"],"grantAgencies":["NIAMS NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"The American journal of pathology","journalShort":"Am.

Whereas inhibition of the Hedgehog pathway selectively suppressed sebocyte development, Hedgehog pathway activation led to a striking increase both in size and number of sebaceous glands. Remarkably, ectopic Hedgehog signaling also triggered the formation of sebaceous glands from footpad epidermis, in regions normally devoid of hair follicles and associated structures. These ectopic sebaceous glands expressed molecular markers of sebocyte differentiation and were functional, secreting their contents directly onto the skin's surface instead of into a hair canal. The Hedgehog pathway thus plays a key role in sebocyte cell fate decisions and is a potential target for treatment of skin disorders linked to abnormal sebaceous gland function, such as acne.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"14597661","pmcid":null,"title":"mBtd is required to maintain signaling during murine limb development.","authors":["Treichel D","Schöck F","Jäckle H","Gruss P","Mansouri A"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Genes & development","journalShort":"Genes Dev.","day":1,"month":11,"year":2003,"meshHeadings":["Amino Acid Sequence","Animals","Apoptosis","Body Patterning","DNA-Binding Proteins","Extremities","Mice","Molecular Sequence Data","Signal Transduction","Transcription Factors"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"buttonhead (btd) encodes an SP1-like transcription factor required for the generation and specification of Drosophila head segments.

This could reflect the absence of an inductive signal in the environment of the dorsal telencephalon and/or the presence of an inhibitory signal. To determine whether either or both mechanisms regulate interneuron generation, progenitors in dorsomedial and dorsolateral wall explants of mouse telencephalon were marked with a retrovirus and cultured under several conditions. When cultured separately, progenitors in dorsomedial wall explants produced fewer GABAergic interneurons than progenitors in dorsolateral wall explants. When cocultured with ventral telencephalic cells, however, dorsomedial wall progenitors produced more GABAergic interneurons than in dorsomedial wall explants alone. The inductive effect of ventral telencephalon depended on sonic hedgehog (Shh) and could be mimicked by exogenous Shh. In contrast, exogenous bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) reduced the production of interneurons in dorsolateral wall explants and inhibited the induction by exogenous Shh. Moreover, inhibiting BMP signaling in dorsomedial wall progenitors with a dominant-negative BMP receptor Ib (dnBMPIb) virus increased their production of interneurons, even if Shh was blocked. Shh and dnBMPRIb increased proliferation and the generation of interneurons, but FGF2 did not induce interneurons, although it increased proliferation. This suggests that proliferation per se does not control the production of interneurons. Our findings suggest that the generation of interneurons by dorsal telencephalic progenitors is normally limited by excess levels of BMPs. Shh may promote the generation of interneurons by antagonizing BMP, but may not be required directly for the generation of interneurons.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"14610062","pmcid":"2173651","title":"Defining BMP functions in the hair follicle by conditional ablation of BMP receptor IA.","authors":["Kobielak K","Pasolli HA","Alonso L","Polak L","Fuchs E"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"The Journal of cell biology","journalShort":"J.

Myogenic precursor cell migration is dependent on limb bud mesenchymal expression of hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (Hgf), which encodes a secreted ligand that signals to dermomyotome through the membrane receptor tyrosine kinase Met. Here, we find that correct patterning of Hgf expression in forelimb buds is dependent on retinoic acid (RA) synthesized by retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (Raldh2) expressed proximally. Raldh2(-/-) forelimb buds lack RA and display an anteroproximal shift in expression of Hgf such that its normally separate dorsal and ventral expression domains are joined into a single anterior-proximal domain. Met and MyoD are expressed in this abnormal domain, indicating that myogenic cell migration and differentiation are occurring in the absence of RA, but in an abnormal location. An RA-reporter transgene revealed that RA signaling in the forelimb bud normally exists in a gradient across the proximodistal axis, but uniformly across the anteroposterior axis, with all proximal limb bud cells exhibiting activity. Expression of Bmp4, an inhibitor of Hgf expression, is increased and shifted anteroproximally in Raldh2(-/-) limb buds, thus encroaching into the normal expression domain of Hgf. Our studies suggest that RA signaling provides proximodistal information for limb buds that counterbalances Bmp signaling, which in turn helps mediate proximodistal and anteroposterior patterning of Hgf expression to correctly direct migration of Met-expressing myogenic precursor cells.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"14651926","pmcid":null,"title":"Zic2 is required for neural crest formation and hindbrain patterning during mouse development.","authors":["Elms P","Siggers P","Napper D","Greenfield A","Arkell R"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Developmental biology","journalShort":"Dev.

Mutation of Zic2 results in a delay of neural crest production and a decrease in the number of neural crest cells that are produced. These defects are independent of mediolateral segmentation of the neurectoderm and of dorsal neurectoderm proliferation, both of which occur normally in the mutant embryos. Additionally Zic2 is required during hindbrain patterning for the normal development of rhombomeres 3 and 5.

Prostatic budding was induced in response to testosterone in Shh null mouse urogenital sinus (UGS) explants grown in vitro and in rat UGS explants cultured with cyclopamine, suggesting that SHH-signalling is not critical for prostatic induction. SHH-signalling was disrupted at later stages of VP development (in vitro), resulting in a reduction in organ size, an increase in ductal tip number, and reduced proliferation of ductal tip epithelia. The addition of recombinant SHH to VPs grown in vitro caused a decrease in ductal tip number and expansion of the mesenchyme. In the presence of testosterone, inhibition of SHH-signalling accelerated the canalisation of prostatic epithelial ducts and resulted in ducts that showed morphological similarities to cribiform prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). The epithelia of these ducts also demonstrated precocious and aberrant differentiation, when examined by immunohistochemistry for p63 and cytokeratin 14.

However, a bud of undifferentiated cecal mesenchymal tissue is maintained throughout development. Our results further indicate that mesenchymal FGF10 acts mostly through the epithelial FGFR2b receptor; thereby triggering invasion of the midgut epithelium into the adjacent mesenchyme via an increased rate of epithelial proliferation at the tip of the cecum.

Presently it is unclear which mesodermal interactions activate which pancreatic transcription factors, and whether such inductions are common for initiating dorsal and ventral pancreas development. Previous studies of Lammert et al. showed that signaling from embryonic blood vessel cells, derived from the mesoderm, promotes pancreatic bud development. Using a combination of mouse Flk1(-/-) embryos lacking endothelial cells and tissue recombination experiments, we discovered that the initial induction of dorsal endoderm cells positive for the pancreatic and duodenal transcription factor Pdx1 does not require aorta or endothelial cell interactions, but dorsal pancreatic bud emergence and the maintenance of Pdx1 expression does. Aortal endothelial cells induce the crucial pancreatic transcription factor Ptf1a in the dorsal pancreatic endoderm; whereas the vitelline veins, which are normally adjacent to the emerging ventral pancreatic bud, are unnecessary for ventral Ptf1a induction or for ventral pancreatic bud initiation. We find that the aorta cells themselves, apart from the blood supply, cause the induction of Ptf1a in dorsal endoderm explants. Thus, endothelial cell interactions specifically promote early dorsal pancreatic development, at least in part, by inducing Ptf1a(+) pancreatic progenitors.

We found that Brn3b influenced gene expression in non RGCs of the retina by controlling the expression of secreted signaling molecules such as sonic hedgehog and myostatin/Gdf8. At later developmental stages, additional alterations in gene expression were secondary consequences of aberrant RGC differentiation caused by the absence of Brn3b. Our results demonstrate that a small but crucial fraction of the RGC transcriptome is dependent on Brn3b. The Brn3b-dependent gene sets therefore provide a unique molecular signature for the developing retina.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"15037319","pmcid":null,"title":"WNT5A signaling affects pituitary gland shape.","authors":["Cha KB","Douglas KR","Potok MA","Liang H","Jones SN","Camper SA"],"grantIds":["2T32 BM 0832213","GM 07863","R37 HD 30428"],"grantAgencies":["FDA HHS","NIGMS NIH HHS","NICHD NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Mechanisms of development","journalShort":"Mech.

The present study analysed molecular and morphological changes in the forebrain of embryos from diabetic Albino Swiss mice. METHODS: Maternal diabetes-induced morphological changes in the forebrain were examined histologically. Cell proliferation index was assayed by BrdU labelling. In situ hybridisation and quantitative real-time PCR were used to analyse the expression of genes coding for sonic hedgehog ( Shh), Nkx2.1, brain factor-1 ( BF-1) and bone morphogenetic protein-4 ( Bmp4) that control forebrain patterning. RESULTS: There were no distinguishable abnormalities in the forebrain of embryos from diabetic pregnancies on embryonic day 0.5. At embryonic day 11.5, embryos of diabetic pregnancies displayed a fusion and thickening of the ventral telencephalic neuroepithelium and a partial absence of the dorsal telencephalon, indicating a severe patterning defect in the dorsoventral axis of the telencephalon. The cell proliferation index was also higher in the ventral telencephalon of these embryos. Molecular analyses indicated that expression of Shh, Nkx2.1 and BF-1 was increased and their expression domains expanded dorsally in the ventral telencephalon in embryos of diabetic mice at embryonic day 11.5. The expression of Bmp4 was reduced in the dorsal forebrain of these embryos. At embryonic day 8.5, only Shh expression was increased.

Neonatal mice lacking functional dehydrocholesterol Delta7-reductase (Dhcr7), a model for the human disease of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, die within 24 hours of birth. Although they have a number of biochemical and structural abnormalities, one cause of death is from apparent respiratory failure due to developmental pulmonary abnormalities. RESULTS: In this study, we characterized further the role of cholesterol deficiency in lung development of these mice. Significant growth retardation, beginning at E14.5 through E16.5, was observed in Dhcr7-/- embryos. Normal lobation but smaller lungs with a significant decrease in lung-to-body weight ratio was noted in Dhcr7-/- embryos, compared to controls. Lung branching morphogenesis was comparable between Dhcr7-/- and controls at early stages, but delayed saccular development was visible in all Dhcr7-/- embryos from E17.5 onwards. Impaired pre-alveolar development of varying severity, inhibited cell proliferation, delayed differentiation of type I alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) and delayed vascular development were all evident in knockout lungs. Differentiation of type II AECs was apparently normal as judged by surfactant protein (SP) mRNAs and SP-C immunostaining. A significant amount of cholesterol was detectable in knockout lungs, implicating some maternal transfer of cholesterol. No significant differences of the spatial-temporal localization of sonic hedgehog (Shh) or its downstream targets by immunohistochemistry were detected between knockout and wild-type lungs and Shh autoprocessing occurred normally in tissues from Dhcr7-/- embryos. CONCLUSION: Our data indicated that cholesterol deficiency caused by Dhcr7 null was associated with a distinct lung saccular hypoplasia, characterized by failure to terminally differentiate alveolar sacs, a delayed differentiation of type I AECs and an immature vascular network at late gestational stages. The molecular mechanism of impaired lung development associated with sterol deficiency by Dhcr7 loss is still unknown, but these results do not support the involvement of dysregulated Shh-Patched-Gli pathway in causing this defect.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"15013801","pmcid":null,"title":"Roles for Hedgehog signaling in androgen production and prostate ductal morphogenesis.","authors":["Berman DM","Desai N","Wang X","Karhadkar SS","Reynon M","Abate-Shen C","Beachy PA","Shen MM"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Developmental biology","journalShort":"Dev.

Unexpectedly, however, we have discovered that this prostate defect could be rescued by three different methods: renal grafting, explant culture in the presence of androgens, and administration of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to pregnant mice, indicating that the prostate defect in Shh mutants is due to insufficient levels of androgens. Furthermore, we find that the inhibition of Hh pathway signaling by treatment with cyclopamine does not block prostate formation in explant culture, but instead produces morphological defects consistent with a role for Hh signaling in ductal patterning.

Cyp26b1 was shown to be expressed in the distal region of the developing limb bud, and mice that lack CYP26B1 exhibited severe limb malformation (meromelia). The lack of CYP26B1 resulted in spreading of the RA signal toward the distal end of the developing limb and induced proximodistal patterning defects characterized by expansion of proximal identity and restriction of distal identity. CYP26B1 deficiency also induced pronounced apoptosis in the developing limb and delayed chondrocyte maturation. Wild-type embryos exposed to excess RA phenocopied the limb defects of Cyp26b1(-/-) mice.

This process involves extracellular signals of the Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFbeta) family. The aim of this work was to study the effects of activin A, a member of this family, whose potential role in pancreas differentiation is controversial. To this end, we used pancreatic explants from E12.5 mouse embryos. In culture these explants exhibited spontaneous growth, epithelial morphogenesis and endocrine and exocrine differentiation. Exposure to activin A did not affect exocrine or endocrine differentiation. Surprisingly, activin A induced in the explants the appearance of a large contractile structure surrounded by a cylindrical epithelium, a thick basal lamina and a smooth muscle layer. This structure, the formation of which was prevented by follistatin, was typical of an intestinal wall. Consistent with this interpretation, activin A rapidly induced in the explants the mRNAs for fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs), which are markers of the intestine, but not of the pancreas. We also found that induction of the FABPs was preceded by induction of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), a known inducer of intestinal differentiation in the endoderm. Activin B induced neither Shh nor intestinal differentiation. The activin A-mediated intestinal differentiation was blocked by cyclopamine, an inhibitor of Hedgehog signaling, and it was mimicked by Shh. We conclude that activin A does not appear to affect the exocrine or endocrine components of the pancreas, but that it can promote differentiation of pancreatic tissue into intestine via a Shh-dependent mechanism. These findings illustrate the plasticity of differentiation programs in response to extracellular signals in the pancreas and they shed new light on the regulation of pancreas and intestinal development.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"15063181","pmcid":null,"title":"FGF8 dose-dependent regulation of embryonic submandibular salivary gland morphogenesis.","authors":["Jaskoll T","Witcher D","Toreno L","Bringas P","Moon AM","Melnick M"],"grantIds":["R01 HD044157-02"],"grantAgencies":["NICHD NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Developmental biology","journalShort":"Dev.

In this study, we investigated if FGF8 plays a dose-dependent regulatory role during embryonic submandibular salivary gland (SMG) morphogenesis. We evaluated SMG phenotypes of Fgf8 hypomorphic mice, which have decreased Fgf8 gene function throughout embryogenesis. We also evaluated SMG phenotypes of Fgf8 conditional mutants in which Fgf8 function has been completely ablated in its expression domain in the first pharyngeal arch ectoderm from the time of arch formation. Fgf8 hypomorphs have hypoplastic SMGs, whereas conditional mutant SMGs exhibit ontogenic arrest followed by involution and are absent by E18.5. SMG aplasia in Fgf8 ectoderm conditional mutants indicates that FGF8 signaling is essential for the morphogenesis and survival of Pseudoglandular Stage and older SMGs. Equally important, the presence of an initial SMG bud in Fgf8 conditional mutants indicates that initial bud formation is FGF8 independent. Mice heterozygous for either the Fgf8 null allele (Fgf8(+/N)) or the hypomorphic allele (Fgf8(+/H)) have SMGs that are indistinguishable from wild-type (Fgf8(+/+)) mice which suggest that there is not only an FGF8 dose-dependent phenotypic response, but a nonlinear, threshold-like, epistatic response as well. We also found that enhanced FGF8 signaling induced, and abrogated FGF8 signaling decreased, SMG branching morphogenesis in vitro. Furthermore, since FGF10 and Shh expression is modulated by Fgf8 levels, we postulated that exogenous FGF10, Shh, or FGF10 + Shh peptide supplementation in vitro would largely \"rescue\" the abnormal SMG phenotype associated with decreased FGF8 signaling. This is as expected, though there is no synergistic effect with FGF10 + Shh peptide supplementation.

Heslike is coexpressed with the bHLH factor Mash1 in brain regions that give rise to GABAergic neurons. In the mesencephalon and the caudal diencephalon, coexpression of Heslike and Mash1 is initially restricted to small regions but expanded dorsally from embryonic day 9.5 onward, and this expansion of coexpression is followed by GABAergic neurogenesis. Misexpression of Heslike in mouse embryos generates ectopic GABAergic neurons only from the Mash1(+) region. In contrast, in the mesencephalon and the caudal diencephalon of Mash1-null mice, GABAergic neurons are almost completely missing and, instead, other neurons are generated, although Heslike is still expressed. Furthermore, coexpression of Heslike and Mash1 significantly promotes formation of GABAergic neurons, compared with each gene alone, in neural precursor cell culture. Thus, Heslike or Mash1 alone is not sufficient, but their coexpression may be important for generation of GABAergic neurons.

We report that Raldh2(-/-) embryos lack trunk mesodermal RA activity and fail to initiate forelimb development. This is associated with deficient expression of important limb determinants Tbx5, Meis2, and dHand needed to establish forelimb bud initiation, proximal identity, and the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA), respectively. Limb expression of these genes can be rescued by maternal RA treatment limited to embryonic day 8 (E8) during limb field establishment, but the mutant forelimbs obtained at E10 display a significant growth defect associated with a smaller apical ectodermal ridge (AER), referred to here as an apical ectodermal mound (AEM). In these RA-deficient forelimbs, a ZPA expressing Shh forms, but it is located distally adjacent to the Fgf8 expression domain in the AEM rather than posteriorly as is normal. AER formation in Raldh2(-/-) forelimbs is rescued by continuous RA treatment through E10, which restores RA to distal ectoderm fated to become the AER. Our findings indicate the existence of an early phase of RA signaling acting upstream of Tbx5, Meis2, and dHand, followed by a late phase of RA signaling needed to expand AER structure fully along the distal ectoderm. During ZPA formation, RA acts early to activate expression of dHand, but it is not required later for Shh activation.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"15065125","pmcid":null,"title":"Loss of Gli3 and Shh function disrupts olfactory axon trajectories.","authors":["Balmer CW","LaMantia AS"],"grantIds":["HD29178"],"grantAgencies":["NICHD NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"The Journal of comparative neurology","journalShort":"J.

These axons project as a single nerve toward the mutant forebrain; however, their trajectory varies according to the position of the proboscis relative to the forebrain.

The molecular events in the normal and abnormal development of the genital tubercle (GT) are still obscure. Genetically engineered mice with specific gene deletions that affect genital anatomy are a useful tool to better understand the etiology of genital abnormalities. In this study, we compared the genital tubercle anatomy of the androgen receptor (AR) deficient, fibroblastic growth factor (FGF)-10 deficient and Sonic HedgeHog (Shh) deficient mutant male mice to that of the wild type male and female mouse. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The lower pelvis of the androgen receptor deficient, FGF-10 deficient, Shh deficient mutant male and wild type male and female mouse at different gestational days (E13-21) and post natal ages (1 day-1 week) were studied. GTs were imaged, serially sectioned and stained immunohistochemically with antibodies raised against E-Cadherin, Cytokeratin 7, 10 and 14. Serial sections of the GTs were selected and three-dimensional computerized images were created to better elucidate the anatomy. RESULTS: AR deficient mutant male mouse revealed a distinctive GT anatomy, different from both sexes. The corporal bodies and glans remained hypoplastic whereas the urethral spongiosa was more developed than the wild type female counterpart. This finding is consistent with the AR mutant mouse being a unique morphologic phenotype distinct from the normal male and female. FGF-10 deficient mutant male mouse revealed normal corporal bodies with failure of the urethral plate to fuse ventrally consistent with hypospadias. The Shh deficient mutant mouse demonstrated complete agenesis of GT outgrowth and a persistent cloaca. CONCLUSION: Animal models bred by gene knockout technology or natural occurring mutants contribute to the basic understanding of normal and abnormal GT development. The anatomy of the these three mutant mice confirms the importance of the androgen receptor, FGF-10 and Shh in genital development.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"15136723","pmcid":null,"title":"Cdx2 is essential for axial elongation in mouse development.","authors":["Chawengsaksophak K","de Graaff W","Rossant J","Deschamps J","Beck F"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","journalShort":"Proc.

Here we identify sonic hedgehog (Shh) as a novel regulator of thyroid development. In Shh knockout mice the thyroid primordium is correctly specified in the pharyngeal endoderm, but budding and dislocation are slightly delayed. In late development the thyroid fails to form a bilobed gland. Instead a single thyroid mass is found unilaterally and mostly to the left of the midline. Thyroid-specific transcription factors (TTF-1 and TTF-2) and thyroglobulin are expressed indicating terminal differentiation. Strikingly, TTF-1- and TTF-2-positive cells aberrantly develop in the presumptive trachea of Shh-/- embryos. The ectopic tissue buds ventrolaterally into the adjacent mesenchyme, and less extensively into the tracheal lumen, forming follicle-like structures that accumulate thyroglobulin.

The results indicate that Shh signaling indirectly governs the symmetric bilobation of the thyroid during late organogenesis.

Teeth form as ectodermal appendages and their development is regulated by interactions between the epithelium and mesenchyme. We have shown previously that Runx2 is expressed in the dental mesenchyme and regulated by FGF signals from the epithelium, and that tooth development arrests at late bud stage in Runx2 knockout mice [Development 126 (1999) 2911]. In the present study, we have continued to clarify the role of Runx2 in tooth development and searched for downstream targets of Runx2 by extensive in situ hybridization analysis. The expression of Fgf3 was downregulated in the mesenchyme of Runx2 mutant teeth. FGF-soaked beads failed to induce Fgf3 expression in Runx2 mutant dental mesenchyme whereas in wild-type mesenchyme they induced Fgf3 in all explants indicating a requirement of Runx2 for transduction of FGF signals. Fgf3 was absent also in cultured Runx2-/- calvarial cells and it was induced by overexpression of Runx2. Furthermore, Runx2 was downregulated in Msx1 mutant tooth germs, indicating that it functions in the dental mesenchyme between Msx1 and Fgf3. Shh expression was absent from the epithelial enamel knot in lower molars of Runx2 mutant and reduced in upper molars. However, other enamel knot marker genes were expressed normally in mutant upper molars, while reduced or missing in lower molars. These differences between mutant upper and lower molars may be explained by the substitution of Runx2 function by Runx3, another member of the runt gene family that was upregulated in upper but not lower molars of Runx2 mutants. Shh expression in mutant enamel knots was not rescued by FGFs in vitro, indicating that in addition to Fgf3, Runx2 regulates other mesenchymal genes required for early tooth morphogenesis. Also, exogenous FGF and SHH did not rescue the morphogenesis of Runx2 mutant molars. We conclude that Runx2 mediates the functions of epithelial FGF signals regulating Fgf3 expression in the dental mesenchyme and that Fgf3 may be a direct target gene of Runx2.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"15107405","pmcid":null,"title":"Hedgehog signaling in the neural crest cells regulates the patterning and growth of facial primordia.","authors":["Jeong J","Mao J","Tenzen T","Kottmann AH","McMahon AP"],"grantIds":["DK 56246","NS 33642"],"grantAgencies":["NIDDK NIH HHS","NINDS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Genes & development","journalShort":"Genes Dev.","day":15,"month":4,"year":2004,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Face","Hedgehog Proteins","Humans","Membrane Proteins","Mesoderm","Mice","Neural Crest","Proto-Oncogene Proteins","Receptors, Cell Surface","Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled","Signal Transduction","Skull","Trans-Activators","Wnt Proteins","Zebrafish Proteins"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Facial abnormalities in human SHH mutants have implicated the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway in craniofacial development, but early defects in mouse Shh mutants have precluded the experimental analysis of this phenotype.

Removing Hh signaling in NCCs also leads to increased apoptosis and decreased cell proliferation in the BAs, which results in facial truncation that is evident by embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5). Together, our results demonstrate that Hh signaling in NCCs is essential for normal patterning and growth of the face. Further, our analysis of Shh-Fox gene regulatory interactions leads us to propose that Fox genes mediate the action of Shh in facial development.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"15105370","pmcid":null,"title":"Otx2 regulates the extent, identity and fate of neuronal progenitor domains in the ventral midbrain.","authors":["Puelles E","Annino A","Tuorto F","Usiello A","Acampora D","Czerny T","Brodski C","Ang SL","Wurst W","Simeone A"],"grantIds":["MC_U117570533"],"grantAgencies":["Medical Research Council"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":23,"month":5,"year":2004,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Body Patterning","Cell Differentiation","Cell Lineage","DNA-Binding Proteins","Embryo, Mammalian","Embryonic Induction","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Hedgehog Proteins","Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 3-beta","Homeodomain Proteins","In Situ Hybridization","Mesencephalon","Mice","Mice, Knockout","Nerve Tissue Proteins","Neurons","Nuclear Proteins","Otx Transcription Factors","Signal Transduction","Stem Cells","Trans-Activators","Transcription Factors"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"The specification of distinct neuronal cell-types is controlled by inducing signals whose interpretation in distinct areas along the central nervous system provides neuronal progenitors with a precise and typical expression code of transcription factors.

To achieve this, Otx2 was inactivated by Cre recombinase under the transcriptional control of En1. Lack of Otx2 in the ventrolateral and posterior midbrain results in a dorsal expansion of Shh expression and in a dorsal and anterior rotation of the midbrain-hindbrain boundary and Fgf8 expression. Indeed, in this mutant correct positioning of the ventral site of midbrain-hindbrain boundary and Fgf8 expression are efficiently controlled by Otx1 function, thus allowing the study of the identity and fate of neuronal progenitors of the ventral midbrain in the absence of Otx2. Our results suggest that Otx2 acts in two ways: by repressing Nkx2.2 in the ventral midbrain and maintaining the Nkx6.1-expressing domain through dorsal antagonism on Shh. Failure of this control affects the identity code and fate of midbrain progenitors, which exhibit features in common with neuronal precursors of the rostral hindbrain even though the midbrain retains its regional identity and these neuronal precursors are rostral to Fgf8 expression. Dopaminergic neurons are greatly reduced in number, red nucleus precursors disappear from the ventral midbrain where a relevant number of serotonergic neurons are generated.

This ectopic expression is not associated with Shh transcription but with Shh protein, undetectable in the presence of epithelium. These findings suggest that, in diastema mesenchyme, restriction of Shh activity is dependent upon the overlying epithelium. This inhibitory activity was demonstrated by the ability of transplanted diastema epithelium to downregulate Ptc1 in tooth explants, and for isolated diastema mesenchyme to express Ptc1. A candidate inhibitor in diastema mesenchyme is the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked membrane glycoprotein Gas1.

It was further hypothesized that these alterations would be correlated with changes in the expression of genes in the Shh pathway. EDL did not alter epididymal segmentation, but Shh, Ptc, and Gli1 expression was significantly altered at specific times after the ligation. The presence of the signaling pathway in the adult epididymis is a novel finding, as is the fact that in the distal epididymis, the specific gene expressions are altered by EDL. This suggests that the genes are capable of being regulated in a manner that is influenced by testicular contribution, and it implies that those genes have a function in the epididymis subject to that regulation.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"15215207","pmcid":null,"title":"Transduction of graded Hedgehog signaling by a combination of Gli2 and Gli3 activator functions in the developing spinal cord.","authors":["Lei Q","Zelman AK","Kuang E","Li S","Matise MP"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":20,"month":8,"year":2004,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Body Patterning","Cell Differentiation","Cell Lineage","Chick Embryo","DNA-Binding Proteins","Embryo, Mammalian","Hedgehog Proteins","In Situ Hybridization","Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors","Mice","Mice, Knockout","Nerve Tissue Proteins","Neurons","Signal Transduction","Spinal Cord","Stem Cells","Trans-Activators","Transcription Factors"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"The three vertebrate Gli proteins play a central role in mediating Hedgehog (Hh)-dependent cell fate specification in the developing spinal cord; however, their individual contributions to this process have not been fully characterized.

Yet in most vertebrate tissues it is unclear which Hh-responses are the direct result of Hh action on a particular cell type because Hhs frequently elicit secondary signals. In developing skeletal muscle, Hhs promote slow myogenesis in zebrafish and are involved in specification of medial muscle cells in amniote somites. However, the extent to which non-myogenic cells, myoblasts or differentiating myocytes are direct or indirect targets of Hh signalling is not known. RESULTS: We show that Sonic hedgehog (Shh) can act directly on cultured C2 myoblasts, driving Gli1 expression, myogenin up-regulation and terminal differentiation, even in the presence of growth factors that normally prevent differentiation. Distinct myoblasts respond differently to Shh: in some slow myosin expression is increased, whereas in others Shh simply enhances terminal differentiation. Exposure of chick wing bud cells to Shh in culture increases numbers of both muscle and non-muscle cells, yet simultaneously enhances differentiation of myoblasts. The small proportion of differentiated muscle cells expressing definitive slow myosin can be doubled by Shh. Shh over-expression in chick limb bud reduces muscle mass at early developmental stages while inducing ectopic slow muscle fibre formation. Abundant later-differentiating fibres, however, do not express extra slow myosin. Conversely, Hh loss of function in the limb bud, caused by implanting hybridoma cells expressing a functionally blocking anti-Hh antibody, reduces early slow muscle formation and differentiation, but does not prevent later slow myogenesis. Analysis of Hh knockout mice indicates that Shh promotes early somitic slow myogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the data show that Hh can have direct pro-differentiative effects on myoblasts and that early-developing muscle requires Hh for normal differentiation and slow myosin expression. We propose a simple model of how direct and indirect effects of Hh regulate early limb myogenesis.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"15215210","pmcid":null,"title":"Differential requirements for Smad4 in TGFbeta-dependent patterning of the early mouse embryo.","authors":["Chu GC","Dunn NR","Anderson DC","Oxburgh L","Robertson EJ"],"grantIds":["059312"],"grantAgencies":["Wellcome Trust"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":20,"month":8,"year":2004,"meshHeadings":["Allantois","Alleles","Animals","Body Patterning","Bone Morphogenetic Proteins","Cell Lineage","DNA-Binding Proteins","Embryo, Mammalian","Embryonic and Fetal Development","Endoderm","Germ Cells","Heart","In Situ Hybridization","Mesoderm","Mice","Mice, Inbred Strains","Mice, Knockout","Morphogenesis","Signal Transduction","Smad4 Protein","Trans-Activators","Transforming Growth Factor beta"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Genetic and biochemical data have identified Smad4 as a key intracellular effector of the transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta superfamily of secreted ligands.

Chimeric analysis reveals a primary requirement for Smad4 in the extra-embryonic lineages; however, within the embryo proper, characterization of the specific roles of Smad4 during gastrulation and lineage specification remains limited. We have employed a Smad4 conditional allele to specifically inactivate the Smad4 gene in the early mouse epiblast. Loss of Smad4 in this tissue results in a profound failure to pattern derivatives of the anterior primitive streak, such as prechordal plate, node, notochord and definitive endoderm. In contrast to these focal defects, many well-characterized TGFbeta- and Bmp-regulated processes involved in mesoderm formation and patterning are surprisingly unaffected. Mutant embryos form abundant extra-embryonic mesoderm, including allantois, a rudimentary heart and middle primitive streak derivatives such as somites and lateral plate mesoderm. Thus, loss of Smad4 in the epiblast results not in global developmental abnormalities but instead in restricted patterning defects. These results suggest that Smad4 potentiates a subset of TGFbeta-related signals during early embryonic development, but is dispensable for others.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"15177029","pmcid":null,"title":"Ext1-dependent heparan sulfate regulates the range of Ihh signaling during endochondral ossification.","authors":["Koziel L","Kunath M","Kelly OG","Vortkamp A"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Developmental cell","journalShort":"Dev.

Furthermore, ES cell chimera experiments indicate that Nodal-deficient ES cells preferentially populate the anterior compartment of the epiblast, suggesting that cell mixing in the epiblast is not random and that Nodal signaling mediates a novel anterior-posterior cell-sorting process within the epiblast before gastrulation.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"15328019","pmcid":null,"title":"The roles of Fgf4 and Fgf8 in limb bud initiation and outgrowth.","authors":["Boulet AM","Moon AM","Arenkiel BR","Capecchi MR"],"grantIds":["K08 HD001373-03"],"grantAgencies":["NICHD NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Developmental biology","journalShort":"Dev.

Based on experiments in the chick, Fgf8 expression in the intermediate mesoderm (IM) has been proposed to play a critical role in the initiation of limb bud outgrowth via restriction of Fgf10 expression to the appropriate region of the lateral plate mesoderm. Contrary to the outcome predicted by this model, ablation of Fgf8 expression in the intermediate mesoderm before limb bud initiation had no effect on initial limb bud outgrowth or on the formation of normal limbs. When their expression patterns were first elucidated, both Fgf4 and Fgf8 were proposed to mediate critical functions of the apical ectodermal ridge (AER), which is required for proper limb bud outgrowth. Although mice lacking Fgf4 in the AER have normal limbs, limb development is severely affected in Fgf8 mutants and certain skeletal elements are not produced. By creating mice lacking both Fgf4 and Fgf8 function in the forelimb AER, we show that limb bud mesenchyme fails to survive in the absence of both FGF family members. Thus, Fgf4 is responsible for the partial compensation of distal limb development in the absence of Fgf8. A prolonged period of increased apoptosis, beginning at 10 days of gestation in a proximal-dorsal region of the limb bud, leads to the elimination of enough mesenchymal cells to preclude formation of distal limb structures. Expression of Shh and Fgf10 is nearly abolished in double mutant limb buds. By using a CRE driver expressed in both forelimb and hindlimb ectoderm to inactivate Fgf4 and Fgf8, we have produced mice lacking all limbs, allowing a direct comparison of FGF requirements in the two locations.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"15256670","pmcid":null,"title":"The limb bud Shh-Fgf feedback loop is terminated by expansion of former ZPA cells.","authors":["Scherz PJ","Harfe BD","McMahon AP","Tabin CJ"],"grantIds":["5T32GM0719T6","HD32443","NS33642"],"grantAgencies":["NIGMS NIH HHS","NICHD NIH HHS","NINDS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","journalShort":"Science","day":16,"month":7,"year":2004,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Cell Division","Chick Embryo","Down-Regulation","Feedback, Physiological","Fibroblast Growth Factor 4","Fibroblast Growth Factor 8","Fibroblast Growth Factor 9","Fibroblast Growth Factors","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Hedgehog Proteins","Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins","Limb Buds","Mesoderm","Mice","Models, Biological","Proto-Oncogene Proteins","Signal Transduction","Trans-Activators","Up-Regulation"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Vertebrate limb outgrowth is driven by a positive feedback loop involving Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), Gremlin, and Fgf4.

Neural stem cells are known to change their competency over time during development: they initially undergo self-renewal only and then give rise to neurons first and glial cells later. Maintenance of neural stem cells until late stages is thus believed to be essential for generation of cells in correct numbers and diverse types, but little is known about how the timing of cell differentiation is regulated and how its deregulation influences brain organogenesis. Here, we report that inactivation of Hes1 and Hes5, known Notch effectors, and additional inactivation of Hes3 extensively accelerate cell differentiation and cause a wide range of defects in brain formation. In Hes-deficient embryos, initially formed neuroepithelial cells are not properly maintained, and radial glial cells are prematurely differentiated into neurons and depleted without generation of late-born cells. Furthermore, loss of radial glia disrupts the inner and outer barriers of the neural tube, disorganizing the histogenesis. In addition, the forebrain lacks the optic vesicles and the ganglionic eminences. Thus, Hes genes are essential for generation of brain structures of appropriate size, shape and cell arrangement by controlling the timing of cell differentiation.

These data suggest that correct temporal regulation of hedgehog activity is a key factor in ensuring epidermal stem cell maintenance. In addition, we observed Shh and Dhh transgenic skin from both phenotypes developed lesions reminiscent of human basal cell carcinoma (BCC), indicating that BCCs can be generated despite the loss of much of the proliferative (basal) compartment.

Their formation is regulated by interactions between the ectoderm and underlying mesenchyme, and several signalling molecules have been implicated as activators or inhibitors of placode formation. Ectodysplasin (Eda) is a unique signalling molecule in the tumour necrosis factor family that, together with its receptor Edar, is necessary for normal development of ectodermal organs both in humans and mice. We have shown previously that overexpression of the Eda-A1 isoform in transgenic mice stimulates the formation of several ectodermal organs. In the present study, we have analysed the formation and morphology of placodes using in vivo and in vitro models in which both the timing and amount of Eda-A1 applied could be varied. The hair and tooth placodes of K14-Eda-A1 transgenic embryos were enlarged, and extra placodes developed from the dental lamina and mammary line. Exposure of embryonic skin to Eda-A1 recombinant protein in vitro stimulated the growth and fusion of placodes. However, it did not accelerate the initiation of the first wave of hair follicles giving rise to the guard hairs. Hence, the function of Eda-A1 appears to be downstream of the primary inductive signal required for placode initiation during skin patterning. Analysis of BrdU incorporation indicated that the formation of the epithelial thickening in early placodes does not involve increased cell proliferation and also that the positive effect of Eda-A1 on placode expansion is not a result of increased cell proliferation.

Because megalin mediates endocytic uptake and degradation of BMP4, these findings indicate a role for megalin in neural tube specification, possibly by acting as BMP4 clearance receptor in the neuroepithelium.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"15625189","pmcid":null,"title":"Sustained Hedgehog signaling is required for basal cell carcinoma proliferation and survival: conditional skin tumorigenesis recapitulates the hair growth cycle.","authors":["Hutchin ME","Kariapper MS","Grachtchouk M","Wang A","Wei L","Cummings D","Liu J","Michael LE","Glick A","Dlugosz AA"],"grantIds":["AR07197","AR45973","CA46592","CA87837"],"grantAgencies":["NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS","NCI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Genes & development","journalShort":"Genes Dev.","day":15,"month":1,"year":2005,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Apoptosis","Carcinoma, Basal Cell","Cell Differentiation","Cell Proliferation","Epithelial Cells","Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic","Hair Follicle","Hedgehog Proteins","Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors","Mice","Mice, Transgenic","Signal Transduction","Skin Neoplasms","Stem Cells","Trans-Activators","Transcription Factors"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Temporally and spatially constrained Hedgehog (Hh) signaling regulates cyclic growth of hair follicle epithelium while constitutive Hh signaling drives the development of basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), the most common cancers in humans.

We have recently shown that Shh also controls the behavior of cells with stem cell properties in the mouse embryonic neocortex, and additional studies have implicated it in the control of cell proliferation in the adult ventral forebrain and in the hippocampus. However, it remains unclear whether it regulates adult stem cell lineages in an equivalent manner. Similarly, it is not known which cells respond to Shh signaling in stem cell niches. Here we demonstrate that Shh is required for cell proliferation in the mouse forebrain's subventricular zone (SVZ) stem cell niche and for the production of new olfactory interneurons in vivo. We identify two populations of Gli1+ Shh signaling responding cells: GFAP+ SVZ stem cells and GFAP- precursors. Consistently, we show that Shh regulates the self-renewal of neurosphere-forming stem cells and that it modulates proliferation of SVZ lineages by acting as a mitogen in cooperation with epidermal growth factor (EGF). Together, our data demonstrate a critical and conserved role of Shh signaling in the regulation of stem cell lineages in the adult mammalian brain, highlight the subventricular stem cell astrocytes and their more abundant derived precursors as in vivo targets of Shh signaling, and demonstrate the requirement for Shh signaling in postnatal and adult neurogenesis.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"15590741","pmcid":null,"title":"Epithelial hedgehog signals pattern the intestinal crypt-villus axis.","authors":["Madison BB","Braunstein K","Kuizon E","Portman K","Qiao XT","Gumucio DL"],"grantIds":["P01 DK062041","T32-HL07505"],"grantAgencies":["NIDDK NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":29,"month":1,"year":2005,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Body Patterning","Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4","Bone Morphogenetic Proteins","Cell Differentiation","Cytoskeletal Proteins","DNA, Complementary","Epithelial Cells","Epithelium","Fibroblasts","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Hedgehog Proteins","Humans","Immunohistochemistry","In Situ Hybridization","Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins","Intestines","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Mice, Transgenic","Microfilament Proteins","Microscopy, Fluorescence","Muscle, Smooth","Rats","Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction","Signal Transduction","Time Factors","Trans-Activators","Transgenes","Wnt Proteins","beta Catenin"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Morphological development of the small intestinal mucosa involves the stepwise remodeling of a smooth-surfaced endodermal tube to form finger-like luminal projections (villi) and flask-shaped invaginations (crypts).

Sonic (Shh) and Indian (Ihh) hedgehog are expressed in the epithelium throughout these morphogenic events, and mice lacking either factor exhibit intestinal abnormalities. To examine the combined role of Shh and Ihh in intestinal morphogenesis, we generated transgenic mice expressing the pan-hedgehog inhibitor, Hhip (hedgehog interacting protein) in the epithelium. We demonstrate that hedgehog (Hh) signaling in the neonatal intestine is paracrine, from epithelium to Ptch1-expressing subepithelial myofibroblasts (ISEMFs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Strong inhibition of this signal compromises epithelial remodeling and villus formation. Surprisingly, modest attenuation of Hh also perturbs villus patterning. Desmin-positive smooth muscle progenitors are expanded, and ISEMFs are mislocalized. This mesenchymal change secondarily affects the epithelium: Tcf4/beta-catenin target gene activity is enhanced, proliferation is increased, and ectopic precrypt structures form on villus tips. Thus, through a combined Hh signal to underlying ISEMFs, the epithelium patterns the crypt-villus axis, ensuring the proper size and location of the emerging precrypt compartment.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"15630473","pmcid":"539061","title":"A signaling pathway involving TGF-beta2 and snail in hair follicle morphogenesis.","authors":["Jamora C","Lee P","Kocieniewski P","Azhar M","Hosokawa R","Chai Y","Fuchs E"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"PLoS biology","journalShort":"PLoS Biol.","day":4,"month":1,"year":2005,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Blotting, Western","Cadherins","Cell Communication","Cell Proliferation","Down-Regulation","Epithelium","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Hair Follicle","Immunohistochemistry","MAP Kinase Signaling System","Mice","Mice, Transgenic","Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction","Signal Transduction","Skin","Time Factors","Transcription Factors","Transcription, Genetic","Transforming Growth Factor beta","Transforming Growth Factor beta2"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"In a common theme of organogenesis, certain cells within a multipotent epithelial sheet exchange signals with their neighbors and develop into a bud structure.

Furthermore, a transgenic reporter gene flanked with this conserved non-coding region shows normal polarized expression in mouse limb buds. This conserved sequence has therefore been proposed to act as a long-range, cis-acting regulator of limb-specific Shh expression. Previous phylogenetic studies have also shown that this sequence is highly conserved among tetrapods, and even in teleost fishes. Paired fins of teleost fishes and tetrapod limbs have evolved from common ancestral appendages, and polarized Shh expression is commonly observed in fins.

Next, we show that deletion of this conserved intronic sequence by targeted mutation in the mouse results in a complete loss of Shh expression in the limb bud and degeneration of skeletal elements distal to the stylopod/zygopod junction.

These results suggest that the conserved intronic sequence evolved in a common ancestor of fishes and tetrapods to control fin and limb development.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"15668254","pmcid":null,"title":"Compensatory roles of Foxa1 and Foxa2 during lung morphogenesis.","authors":["Wan H","Dingle S","Xu Y","Besnard V","Kaestner KH","Ang SL","Wert S","Stahlman MT","Whitsett JA"],"grantIds":["HL38859","HL56387","HL75770","MC_U117570533"],"grantAgencies":["NHLBI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","Medical Research Council"],"retractions":[],"journal":"The Journal of biological chemistry","journalShort":"J.

Recently, pancreas atrophies have been reported in several maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5 patients, suggesting that TCF2 is required not only for adult pancreas function but also for its normal development. Tcf2-deficient mice die before gastrulation because of defective visceral endoderm formation. To investigate the role of this factor in pancreas development, we rescued this early lethality by tetraploid aggregation. We show that TCF2 has an essential function in the first steps of pancreas development, correlated with its expression domain that demarcates the entire pancreatic buds from the earliest stages. Lack of TCF2 results in pancreas agenesis by embryonic day 13.5. At earlier stages, only a dorsal bud rudiment forms transiently and expresses the transcription factors Ipf1 and Hlxb9 but lacks the key transcription factor involved in the acquisition of a pancreatic fate, Ptf1a, as well as all endocrine precursor cells. Regional specification of the gut also is perturbed in Tcf2-/- embryos as manifested by ectopic expression of Shh and lack of Ihh and Ipf1 in the posterior stomach and duodenum. Our results highlight the requirement of Tcf2 for ensuring both accurate expression of key regulator molecules in the stomach-duodenal epithelium and proper acquisition of the pancreatic fate.

In contrast, Hedgehog signaling components are found within pancreatic tissue during subsequent stages of development as well as in the mature organ, indicating that a certain level of pathway activation is required for normal organ development and function.

Here, we describe for the first time the defects caused by loss of Blimp1 function in the mouse. Blimp1 deficient embryos die at mid-gestation, but surprisingly early axis formation, anterior patterning and neural crest formation proceed normally.

In the mouse, molecular marker studies indicate that the sirenomelia phenotype is associated with a defect in the formation of ventroposterior mesoderm. These experiments demonstrate that dorsoventral patterning of the mouse posterior mesoderm is regulated by Bmp signaling, as is the case in other vertebrates. Sirens result from a fusion of the hindlimb buds caused by a defect in the formation of ventral mesoderm.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"15843416","pmcid":null,"title":"Development of the mammalian urethra is controlled by Fgfr2-IIIb.","authors":["Petiot A","Perriton CL","Dickson C","Cohn MJ"],"grantIds":["HD047885","R21 HD047885"],"grantAgencies":["NICHD NIH HHS","NICHD NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":28,"month":5,"year":2005,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Cell Proliferation","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Green Fluorescent Proteins","Histological Techniques","Hypospadias","Immunohistochemistry","In Situ Hybridization","Male","Mice","Morphogenesis","Protein Isoforms","Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases","Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2","Receptors, Androgen","Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor","Signal Transduction","Urethra"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Development of external genitalia in mammalian embryos requires tight coordination of a complex series of morphogenetic events involving outgrowth, proximodistal and dorsoventral patterning, and epithelial tubulogenesis. Hypospadias is a congenital defect of the external genitalia that results from failure of urethral tube closure. Although this is the second most common birth defect in humans, affecting one in every 250 children, the molecular mechanisms that regulate morphogenesis of the mammalian urethra are poorly understood. We report that mice lacking the IIIb isoform of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (Fgfr2) exhibit severe hypospadias. Urethral signaling regions, as indicated by Shh and Fgf8 expression, are established in Fgfr2-IIIb null mice; however, cell proliferation arrests prematurely and maturation of the urethral epithelium is disrupted. Fgfr2-IIIb-/- mutants fail to maintain the progenitor cell population required for uroepithelial renewal during tubular morphogenesis. In addition, we show that antagonism of the androgen receptor (AR) leads to loss of Fgfr2-IIIb and Fgf10 expression in the urethra, and an associated hypospadias phenotype, suggesting that these genes are downstream targets of AR during external genital development. Genitourinary defects resulting from disruption of AR activity, by either genetic or environmental factors, may therefore involve negative regulation of the Fgfr2 pathway. This represents the first example of how the developing genitourinary system integrates cues from systemically circulating steroid hormones with a locally expressed growth factor pathway.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"15804569","pmcid":null,"title":"Six1 is not involved in limb tendon development, but is expressed in limb connective tissue under Shh regulation.","authors":["Bonnin MA","Laclef C","Blaise R","Eloy-Trinquet S","Relaix F","Maire P","Duprez D"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Mechanisms of development","journalShort":"Mech.

IFT proteins are required for the formation and maintenance of flagella and cilia. We have previously shown that mouse mutants for two IFT proteins, IFT88 and IFT172, as well as Kif3a, a subunit of mouse kinesin 2, exhibit ventral spinal cord patterning defects that appear to result from reduced hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Although genetic epistasis experiments place IFT proteins downstream of the Hh receptor and upstream of the Gli transcription factors, the mechanism by which IFT regulates Gli function is unknown. The developing limb provides an excellent system to study Hh signaling, in particular as it allows a biological and molecular readout of both Gli activator and repressor function. Here we report that homozygous mutants for flexo (Fxo), a hypomorphic allele of mouse IFT88 generated in our ENU mutagenesis screen, exhibit polydactyly in all four limbs. Molecular analysis indicates that expression domains of multiple posteriorly restricted genes are expanded anteriorly in the mutant limbs, similar to loss of Gli3 transcriptional repressor function. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) expression is normal, yet Ptch1 and Gli1, two known targets of Hh signaling, are greatly reduced, consistent with loss of Shh signaling. Expression of Gli3 and Hand2 in the mutant limb indicates that the limb prepattern is abnormal. In addition, we show that partial loss-of-function mutations in another mouse IFT gene, Ift52 (Ngd5), result in similar phenotypes and abnormal Hh signaling as Fxo, indicating a general requirement for IFT proteins in Hh signaling and patterning of multiple organs. Analysis of Ift88 and Shh double mutants indicates that, in mouse, IFT proteins are required for both Gli activator and repressor functions, and Gli proteins are insensitive to Hh ligand in the absence of IFT proteins. Finally, our biochemical studies demonstrate that IFT proteins are required for proteolytic processing of Gli3 in mouse embryos. In summary, our results indicate that IFT function is crucial in the control of both the positive and negative transcriptional activities of Gli proteins, and essential for Hh ligand-induced signaling cascade.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"15936916","pmcid":null,"title":"Molecular signaling in intervertebral disk development.","authors":["DiPaola CP","Farmer JC","Manova K","Niswander LA"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society","journalShort":"J.

Here we show that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling triggers secretion of membrane-sheathed objects 0.3-5 microm in diameter termed 'nodal vesicular parcels' (NVPs) that carry Sonic hedgehog and retinoic acid. These NVPs are transported leftward by the fluid flow and eventually fragment close to the left wall of the ventral node. The silencing effects of the FGF-receptor inhibitor SU5402 on NVP secretion and on a downstream rise in Ca2+ were sufficiently reversed by exogenous Sonic hedgehog peptide or retinoic acid, suggesting that FGF-triggered surface accumulation of cargo morphogens may be essential for launching NVPs.

The diencephalon yields the pretectum, thalamus, and prethalamus, and the telencephalon produces the archipallium, neopallium, and ganglionic eminences. By identifying cell descendants that once expressed Emx2 with use of the Cre knock-in mutant into the Emx2 locus and analyzing phenotypes of double mutants between Emx2 and Otx2/Otx1 and between Emx2 and Pax6, we propose that at the 3-6 somite stage, the anterior neuroectoderm develops into three primordia: midbrain, caudal forebrain, and rostral forebrain. The caudal forebrain primordium generates not only the pretectum, thalamus, and prethalamus but also the archipallium, cortical hem, choroid plexus, choroidal roof, and eminentia thalami.

As a result, anterior mesenchyme is not maintained, leading to oligodactyly.

The expression of activin/inhibin betaB (ActbetaB/Inhbb) and transforming growth factor alpha (Tgfa), previously reported to be crucial for eyelid development, is down-regulated in the mutant leading edge, while the onset of sonic hedgehog (Shh) expression is delayed on the mutant eyelid margin. Explant cultures of mouse eyelid primordia shows that the open-eyelid phenotype of the mutant is reduced by exogenous FGF10 protein, and that the expression of ActbetaB and Tgfa is ectopically induced in the thickened eyelid epithelium by the FGF10 protein. These results indicate a dual role of FGF10 in mouse eyelid development, for both proliferation and coordinated migration of eyelid epithelial cells by reorganization of the cytoskeleton, through the regulation of activin, TGFalpha and SHH signaling.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"15961523","pmcid":null,"title":"Wnt-dependent regulation of inner ear morphogenesis is balanced by the opposing and supporting roles of Shh.","authors":["Riccomagno MM","Takada S","Epstein DJ"],"grantIds":["DC006254"],"grantAgencies":["NIDCD NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Genes & development","journalShort":"Genes Dev.","day":1,"month":7,"year":2005,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Base Sequence","Cytoskeletal Proteins","DNA Primers","Ear, Inner","Female","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Hedgehog Proteins","Homeodomain Proteins","Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins","Male","Mice","Mice, Transgenic","Morphogenesis","Signal Transduction","Trans-Activators","Wnt Proteins","Wnt1 Protein","beta Catenin"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"The inner ear is partitioned along its dorsal/ventral axis into vestibular and auditory organs, respectively.

We further show that the source of Wnt impacting on dorsal otic development emanates from the dorsal hindbrain, and identify Wnt1 and Wnt3a as the specific ligands required for this function. The restriction of Wnt target genes to the dorsal otocyst is also influenced by Shh.

Examining gene expressions of these factors at embryonic day (E) 9.5 and 10.5, we unexpectedly found that both VEGF and Ang-1 were expressed in the motor neurons in the ventral neural tube. The motor neurons were indeed located in the close vicinity of the infiltrating vessels, suggesting involvement of motor neurons in the sprouting. To substantiate this possibility, we inhibited induction of the motor neurons in the cultured mouse embryos by cyclopamine, a Shh signaling blocker. The vessel sprouting was dramatically impaired by inhibition of Shh signaling, together with nearly complete loss of the motor neurons. Expression of Ang-1, but not VEGF, within the neural tube was remarkably reduced in the cyclopamine treated embryos.

Recent studies have shown that Retinoic Acid (RA) signaling is essential for the development of the pancreas in non-mammalian vertebrates. To investigate whether RA regulates mouse pancreas development, we have studied the phenotype of mice with a targeted deletion in the retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (Raldh2) gene, encoding the enzyme required to synthesize RA in the embryo. We show that Raldh2 is expressed in the dorsal pancreatic mesenchyme at the early stage of pancreas specification. RA-responding cells have been detected in pancreatic endodermal and mesenchymal cells. Raldh2-deficient mice do not develop a dorsal pancreatic bud. Mutant embryos lack Pdx 1 expression, an essential regulator of early pancreas development, in the dorsal but not the ventral endoderm. In contrast to Pdx 1-deficient mice, the early glucagon-expressing cells do not develop in Raldh2 knockout embryos. Shh expression is, as in the wild-type embryo, excluded from the dorsal endodermal region at the site where the dorsal bud is expected to form, indicating that the dorsal bud defect is not related to a mis-expression of Shh. Mesenchymal expression of the LIM homeodomain protein Isl 1, required for the formation of the dorsal mesenchyme, is altered in Raldh2--/-- embryos. The homeobox gene Hlxb9, which is essential for the initiation of the pancreatic program in the dorsal foregut endoderm, is still expressed in Raldh2--/-- dorsal epithelium but the number of HB9-expressing cells is severely reduced. Maternal supplementation of RA rescues early dorsal pancreas development and restores endodermal Pdx 1 and mesenchymal Isl 1 expression as well as endocrine cell differentiation. These findings suggest that RA signaling is important for the proper differentiation of the dorsal mesenchyme and development of the dorsal endoderm.

The phenotypes of the IFT mutants, however, are not identical to mutants that lack Smoothened (Smo), an essential activator of the Hh pathway. We show here that mouse embryos that lack both Ift172 and Smo are identical to Ift172 single mutants, which indicates that Ift172 acts downstream of Smo. Ift172 mutants have a weaker neural patterning phenotype than Smo mutants, because Ift172, but not Smo, is required for proteolytic processing of Gli3 to its repressor form.

In addition, Shh inhibits caspase-3 activation and apoptosis induced by serum deprivation.

To understand how a single Hh signal is capable of generating distinct readouts in Hh-responsive cells requires elucidation of the signal transduction cascade at the molecular level. Key components that mediate Hh signal transduction downstream of the receptor include Fused (Fu), Suppressor of fused (Sufu), and Costal-2 (Cos2) or the vertebrate homologs Kif27/Kif7. Studies with both invertebrates and vertebrates have led to a model in which a protein complex composed of Fu, Sufu, and Cos2 controls the processing, activity, and subcellular distribution of the Ci/Gli transcription factors responsible for Hh target gene activation. These converging results obtained with different species reaffirm the prevailing view of pathway conservation during evolution. Genetic studies of Fu, Sufu, and Kif27/Kif7 in mice are required to provide further verification of Hh pathway conservation. To this end, we generated a gene-targeted allele of Fu in mice. Surprisingly, our analysis indicates that Fu-deficient mice do not exhibit any embryonic phenotypes indicative of perturbed Hh signaling.

Previously, we showed that targeted disruption of Wnt5a results in over-branching of the epithelium and thickening of the interstitium in embryonic lungs. In this study, we generated and characterized transgenic mice with lung-specific over-expression of Wnt5a from the SpC promoter. Over-expression of Wnt5a interfered with normal epithelial-mesenchymal interactions resulting in reduced epithelial branching and dilated distal airways. During early lung development, over-expression of Wnt5a in the epithelium resulted in increased Fgf10 in the mesenchyme and decreased Shh in the epithelium. Both levels and distribution of SHH receptor, Ptc were reduced in SpC-Wnt5a transgenic lungs and were reciprocally correlated to changes of Fgf10 in the mesenchyme, suggesting that SHH signaling is decreased by over-expression of Wnt5a. Cultured mesenchyme-free epithelial explants from SpC-Wnt5a transgenic lungs responded abnormally to recombinant FGF10 supplied uniformly in the Matrigel with dilated branch tips that mimic the in vivo phenotype. In contrast, chemotaxis of transgenic epithelial explants towards a directional FGF10 source was inhibited. These suggest that over-expression of Wnt5a disrupts epithelial-response to FGF10.

The hair follicle consists of several concentric epithelial sheaths with the outer root sheath (ORS) forming the outermost layer. Functionally, the ORS has been implicated in the migration of hair stem cells from the stem cell niche toward the hair bulb. However, factors required for the differentiation of this critical cell lineage remain to be identified. Here, we describe an unexpected role of the HMG-box-containing gene Sox9 in hair development. RESULTS: Sox9 expression can be first detected in the epithelial component of the hair placode but then becomes restricted to the outer root sheath (ORS) and the hair stem cell compartment (bulge). Using tissue-specific inactivation of Sox9, we demonstrate that this gene serves a crucial role in hair differentiation and that skin deleted for Sox9 lacks external hair. Strikingly, the ORS acquires epidermal characteristics with ectopic expression of GATA3. Moreover, Sox9 knock hair show severe proliferative defects and the stem cell niche never forms. Finally, we show that Sox9 expression depends on sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling and demonstrate overexpression in skin tumors in mouse and man. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that although Sox9 is dispensable for hair induction, it directs differentiation of the ORS and is required for the formation of the hair stem cell compartment. Our genetic analysis places Sox9 in a molecular cascade downstream of sonic hedgehog and suggests that this gene is involved in basal cell carcinoma.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"16127717","pmcid":null,"title":"GATA-4:FOG interactions regulate gastric epithelial development in the mouse.","authors":["Jacobsen CM","Mannisto S","Porter-Tinge S","Genova E","Parviainen H","Heikinheimo M","Adameyko II","Tevosian SG","Wilson DB"],"grantIds":["DK52574"],"grantAgencies":["NIDDK NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists","journalShort":"Dev.

Shh response is interrupted once GCPs move into the inner EGL, where granule progenitors withdraw proliferation and start differentiating and migrating toward the internal granule layer (IGL). Failure to interrupt Shh signals results in uncoordinated proliferation and differentiation of GCPs and eventually leads to malignancy (i.e., medulloblastoma). The Shh inhibitory mechanisms that are responsible for GCP growth arrest and differentiation remain unclear. Here we report that REN, a putative tumor suppressor frequently deleted in human medulloblastoma, is expressed to a higher extent in nonproliferating inner EGL and IGL granule cells than in highly proliferating outer EGL cells. Accordingly, upregulated REN expression occurs along GCP differentiation in vitro, and, in turn, REN overexpression promotes growth arrest and increases the proportion of p27/Kip1+ GCPs. REN also impairs both Gli2-dependent gene transcription and Shh-enhanced expression of the target Gli1 mRNA, thus antagonizing the Shh-induced effects on the proliferation and differentiation of cultured GCPs. Conversely, REN functional knock-down impairs Hedgehog antagonism and differentiation and sustains the proliferation of GCPs. Finally, REN enhances caspase-3 activation and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated UTP nick end labeling apoptotic GCP numbers; therefore, the pattern of REN expression, its activity, and its antagonism on the Hedgehog pathway suggest that this gene may represent a restraint of Shh signaling at the outer to inner EGL GCP transitions. Medulloblastoma-associated REN loss of function might withdraw such a limiting signal for immature cell expansion, thus favoring tumorigenesis.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"16141072","pmcid":null,"title":"The transcriptional landscape of the mammalian genome.","authors":["Carninci P","Kasukawa T","Katayama S","Gough J","Frith MC","Maeda N","Oyama R","Ravasi T","Lenhard B","Wells C","Kodzius R","Shimokawa K","Bajic VB","Brenner SE","Batalov S","Forrest AR","Zavolan M","Davis MJ","Wilming LG","Aidinis V","Allen JE","Ambesi-Impiombato A","Apweiler R","Aturaliya RN","Bailey TL","Bansal M","Baxter L","Beisel KW","Bersano T","Bono H","Chalk AM","Chiu KP","Choudhary V","Christoffels A","Clutterbuck DR","Crowe ML","Dalla E","Dalrymple BP","de Bono B","Della Gatta G","di Bernardo D","Down T","Engstrom P","Fagiolini M","Faulkner G","Fletcher CF","Fukushima T","Furuno M","Futaki S","Gariboldi M","Georgii-Hemming P","Gingeras TR","Gojobori T","Green RE","Gustincich S","Harbers M","Hayashi Y","Hensch TK","Hirokawa N","Hill D","Huminiecki L","Iacono M","Ikeo K","Iwama A","Ishikawa T","Jakt M","Kanapin A","Katoh M","Kawasawa Y","Kelso J","Kitamura H","Kitano H","Kollias G","Krishnan SP","Kruger A","Kummerfeld SK","Kurochkin IV","Lareau LF","Lazarevic D","Lipovich L","Liu J","Liuni S","McWilliam S","Madan Babu M","Madera M","Marchionni L","Matsuda H","Matsuzawa S","Miki H","Mignone F","Miyake S","Morris K","Mottagui-Tabar S","Mulder N","Nakano N","Nakauchi H","Ng P","Nilsson R","Nishiguchi S","Nishikawa S","Nori F","Ohara O","Okazaki Y","Orlando V","Pang KC","Pavan WJ","Pavesi G","Pesole G","Petrovsky N","Piazza S","Reed J","Reid JF","Ring BZ","Ringwald M","Rost B","Ruan Y","Salzberg SL","Sandelin A","Schneider C","Schönbach C","Sekiguchi K","Semple CA","Seno S","Sessa L","Sheng Y","Shibata Y","Shimada H","Shimada K","Silva D","Sinclair B","Sperling S","Stupka E","Sugiura K","Sultana R","Takenaka Y","Taki K","Tammoja K","Tan SL","Tang S","Taylor MS","Tegner J","Teichmann SA","Ueda HR","van Nimwegen E","Verardo R","Wei CL","Yagi K","Yamanishi H","Zabarovsky E","Zhu S","Zimmer A","Hide W","Bult C","Grimmond SM","Teasdale RD","Liu ET","Brusic V","Quackenbush J","Wahlestedt C","Mattick JS","Hume DA","Kai C","Sasaki D","Tomaru Y","Fukuda S","Kanamori-Katayama M","Suzuki M","Aoki J","Arakawa T","Iida J","Imamura K","Itoh M","Kato T","Kawaji H","Kawagashira N","Kawashima T","Kojima M","Kondo S","Konno H","Nakano K","Ninomiya N","Nishio T","Okada M","Plessy C","Shibata K","Shiraki T","Suzuki S","Tagami M","Waki K","Watahiki A","Okamura-Oho Y","Suzuki H","Kawai J","Hayashizaki Y","FANTOM Consortium","RIKEN Genome Exploration Research Group and Genome Science Group (Genome Network Project Core Group)"],"grantIds":["TGM03P17","TGM06S01"],"grantAgencies":["Telethon","Telethon"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","journalShort":"Science","day":2,"month":9,"year":2005,"meshHeadings":["3' Untranslated Regions","Animals","Base Sequence","Conserved Sequence","DNA, Complementary","Genome","Genome, Human","Genomics","Humans","Mice","Promoter Regions, Genetic","Proteins","RNA","RNA Splicing","RNA, Untranslated","Regulatory Sequences, Ribonucleic Acid","Terminator Regions, Genetic","Transcription Initiation Site","Transcription, Genetic"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"This study describes comprehensive polling of transcription start and termination sites and analysis of previously unidentified full-length complementary DNAs derived from the mouse genome.

To gain insight into the as yet unknown biological role of Megf7/Lrp4, we have disrupted the gene in mice. Homozygous Megf7-deficient mice are growth-retarded, with fully penetrant polysyndactyly in their fore and hind limbs, and partially penetrant abnormalities of tooth development. The reason for this developmental abnormality is apparent as early as embryonic day 9.5 when the apical ectodermal ridge (AER), the principal site of Megf7 expression at the distal edge of the embryonic limb bud, forms abnormally in the absence of Megf7. Ectopic expression and aberrant signaling of several molecules involved in limb patterning, including Fgf8, Shh, Bmp2, Bmp4 and Wnt7a, as well as the Wnt- and Bmp-responsive transcription factors Lmx1b and Msx1, result in reduced apoptosis and symmetrical dorsal and ventral expansions of the AER. Abnormal signaling from the AER precedes ectopic chondrocyte condensation and subsequent fusion and duplication of digits in the Megf7 knockouts. Megf7 can antagonize canonical Wnt signaling in vitro. Taken together, these findings are consistent with a role of Megf7 as a modulator of cellular signaling pathways involving Wnts, Bmps, Fgfs and Shh.

These changes are reminiscent of the pre-malignant lesion, intestinal metaplasia. To determine the role of Hedgehog-related transcription factors, Gli2 and Gli3, in Shh signaling during stomach development, we conducted a mutant analysis of glandular stomach from Shh, Gli2, and Gli3 mutant mice. Although Gli2 principally mediates the activator function of Shh, surprisingly we observed minimal changes in glandular development in the Gli2 mutant stomach. Furthermore, Gli3, which typically functions as a repressor of Hedgehog signal, showed a striking phenocopy of the glandular expansion and intestinal transformation found in Shh mutant stomach. A reduction in apoptotic events was seen in all mutant stomachs with no appreciable changes in proliferation. Both Shh and Gli3 mutant stomachs displayed early changes of intestinal transformation but these did not impact on the overall differentiation of the gastric epithelium. Interestingly, the observation that Gli3 shares a similar glandular phenotype to Shh mutant stomach reveals a possible novel role of Gli3 activator in the developing stomach.

The molecular cascades dependent on Gli3 at later stages of limb development, which link early patterning events with final digit morphogenesis, remain poorly characterised. By analysing the transcriptional consequences of loss of Gli3 in the anterior margin of the E11.5 and E12.5 limb bud in the polydactylous mouse mutant extra-toes (Gli3(Xt/Xt)), we have identified a number of known and novel transcripts dependent on Gli3 in the limb.

Thus, Wnt3a links the segmentation clock and AP axis elongation with key left-determining events, suggesting that Wnt3a is an integral component of the trunk organizer.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"16308329","pmcid":null,"title":"Reciprocal epithelial-mesenchymal FGF signaling is required for cecal development.","authors":["Zhang X","Stappenbeck TS","White AC","Lavine KJ","Gordon JI","Ornitz DM"],"grantIds":["P30 DK052574","P30 DK052574-01A19001","P30-DK52574","R01 NS065761"],"grantAgencies":["NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NINDS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":12,"month":1,"year":2006,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Cecum","Epithelium","Fibroblast Growth Factor 10","Fibroblast Growth Factor 9","Immunohistochemistry","In Situ Hybridization","Mesoderm","Mice","Mice, Knockout","Morphogenesis","Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2","Signal Transduction"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling mediates reciprocal mesenchymal-epithelial cell interactions in the developing mouse lung and limb.

Previous studies have suggested that of the four FGF genes specifically expressed in the mouse AER, Fgf8 is unique not only in its expression pattern, but also because it is the only such FGF gene that causes limb skeletal abnormalities when individually inactivated. However, when both Fgf8 and Fgf4 are simultaneously inactivated in the AER, the limb does not develop. One possible explanation for these observations is that although both of these FGF family members contribute to limb development, Fgf8 has functions that Fgf4 cannot perform. To test this hypothesis, we used a novel method to substitute Fgf4 for Fgf8 expression in the developing limb bud by concomitantly activating a conditional Fgf4 gain-of-function allele and inactivating an Fgf8 loss-of-function allele in the same cells via Cre-mediated recombination. Our data show that when Fgf4 is expressed in place of Fgf8, all of the skeletal defects caused by inactivation of Fgf8 are rescued, conclusively demonstrating that FGF4 can functionally replace FGF8 in limb skeletal development. We also show that the increase in FGF signaling that occurs when the Fgf4 gain-of-function allele is activated in a wild-type limb bud causes formation of a supernumerary posterior digit (postaxial polydactyly), as well as cutaneous syndactyly between all the digits.

The objective of the present investigation was to refine the expression pattern of Shh in the mouse epididymis and to determine if the Shh pathway is important for epididymal function vis-à-vis sperm maturation. The former was achieved by microarray analysis of Shh expression in all segments of the mouse epididymis, and the latter was determined by 14-day administration of cyclopamine, a Shh pathway inhibitor, followed by a microassay for the activation and duration of cauda epididymal sperm motility. Shh pathway inhibition was monitored by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for expression of epididymal Gli1 and Gli3. The Gli family of transcription factors is commonly activated and regulated by Shh pathway activation. Cyclopamine treatment reduced Gli1 expression by 61% and initiation of cauda sperm motility by 50%. Gli3 expression was reduced by approximately 50%. Subsequent cluster analysis using the microarray data on epididymal gene expression highlighted several potential target genes for the Shh pathway, the most prominent of which is prostaglandin D2 synthase. These results indicate that an operating Shh pathway is important in the murine epididymis for the development of sperm motility and implies a role for Shh signaling in adult epididymal function.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"16322088","pmcid":null,"title":"Hedgehog signaling maintains resident hepatic progenitors throughout life.","authors":["Sicklick JK","Li YX","Melhem A","Schmelzer E","Zdanowicz M","Huang J","Caballero M","Fair JH","Ludlow JW","McClelland RE","Reid LM","Diehl AM"],"grantIds":["R01 AA 010154","R01 AA 012059","R01 AA 014243","R01 DK 053792","R01 DK 52851","R01 IP30-DK-065933","T32 DK 007713"],"grantAgencies":["NIAAA NIH HHS","NIAAA NIH HHS","NIAAA NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"American journal of physiology.

Here, we describe the first mouse genetic screen that has used direct immunohistochemical visualization methods to systematically identify genetic loci required for cranial nerve development. After screening 40 pedigrees, we recovered seven new neurodevelopmental mutations. Two mutations model human genetic syndromes. Mutation 7-1 causes facial nerve anomalies and a reduced lower jaw, and is located in a region of conserved synteny with an interval associated with the micrognathia and mental retardation of human cri-du-chat syndrome. Mutation 22-1 is in the Pax3 gene and, thus, models human Waardenburg syndrome. Three mutations cause global axon guidance deficits: one interferes with initial motor axon extension from the neural tube, another causes overall axon defasciculation, and the third affects general choice point selection. Another two mutations affect the oculomotor nerve specifically. Oculomotor nerve development, which is disrupted by six mutations, appears particularly sensitive to genetic perturbations. Phenotypic comparisons of these mutants identifies a \"transition zone\" that oculomotor axons enter after initial outgrowth and in which new factors govern additional progress.

The neural defects are associated with improper Shh expression in the underlying rostral axial mesoderm and localized changes of neural marker expression along the dorsoventral axis, as well as with expanded cranial neural tissue and reduced cranial surface ectoderm culminating in a lateral shift of the neuroectoderm/surface ectoderm border. We propose that these defects reflect the involvement of Ovol2 in independent processes such as regionalized gene expression and neural/non-neural ectodermal patterning. Additionally, we present evidence that Ovol2 is required for efficient migration and survival of neural crest cells that arise at the neuroectoderm/surface ectoderm border, but not for their initial formation. Collectively, our studies indicate that Ovol2 is a key regulator of neural development and reveal a previously unexplored role for Ovo genes in mammalian embryogenesis.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"16364285","pmcid":null,"title":"Mouse Rab23 regulates hedgehog signaling from smoothened to Gli proteins.","authors":["Eggenschwiler JT","Bulgakov OV","Qin J","Li T","Anderson KV"],"grantIds":["NS44385"],"grantAgencies":["NINDS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Developmental biology","journalShort":"Dev.

Here, we demonstrate that Rab23 acts upstream of Gli transcription factors in patterning neural cell types in the spinal cord. Double mutant analysis indicates that the primary target of Rab23 is the Gli2 activator and that Rab23 and Gli3 repressor have additive effects on patterning. Analysis of Gli3 protein suggests that Rab23 also has a role in promoting the production of Gli3 repressor. Although the membrane proteins Patched and Smoothened change subcellular localization in response to Shh, double mutant analysis demonstrates that Rab23 does not work through either Patched or Smoothened. Instead, Rab23 appears to regulate subcellular localization of essential components of the Hedgehog pathway that act downstream of Smoothened and upstream of Gli proteins.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"16407397","pmcid":null,"title":"A functional screen for sonic hedgehog regulatory elements across a 1 Mb interval identifies long-range ventral forebrain enhancers.","authors":["Jeong Y","El-Jaick K","Roessler E","Muenke M","Epstein DJ"],"grantIds":["R01 NS39421"],"grantAgencies":["NINDS NIH HHS","Intramural NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":26,"month":2,"year":2006,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Anura","Base Sequence","Central Nervous System","Chickens","Conserved Sequence","Enhancer Elements, Genetic","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Genes, Reporter","Hedgehog Proteins","Humans","Mice","Mice, Transgenic","Molecular Sequence Data","Promoter Regions, Genetic","Prosencephalon","Sequence Analysis, DNA","Tetraodontiformes","Trans-Activators"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"The secreted protein sonic hedgehog (Shh) plays an integral role in forming the ventral midline of the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS).

Central to the understanding of ventral neural tube development is how Shh transcription is regulated in the CNS. To address this issue, we devised an enhancer trap assay to systematically screen 1 Mb of DNA surrounding the Shh locus for the ability to target reporter gene expression to sites of Shh transcription in transgenic mouse embryos. This analysis uncovered six enhancers distributed over 400 kb, the combined activity of which covered all sites of Shh expression in the mouse embryonic CNS from the ventral forebrain to the posterior extent of the spinal cord. To evaluate the relative contribution of these enhancers to the overall pattern of Shh expression, individual elements were deleted in the context of a transgenic Bac reporter assay. Redundant mechanisms were found to control Shh-like reporter activity in the ventral spinal cord, hindbrain and regions of the telencephalon, whereas unique elements regulated Shh-like expression in the ventral midbrain, the majority of the ventral diencephalon and parts of the telencephalon. Three ventral forebrain enhancers locate on the distal side of translocation breakpoints that occurred upstream of Shh in human cases of HPE, suggesting that displacement of these regulatory elements from the Shh promoter is a likely cause of HPE in these individuals.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"16368932","pmcid":null,"title":"Retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH2)-mediated retinoic acid synthesis regulates early mouse embryonic forebrain development by controlling FGF and sonic hedgehog signaling.","authors":["Ribes V","Wang Z","Dollé P","Niederreither K"],"grantIds":["R01 HL070733"],"grantAgencies":["NHLBI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":21,"month":1,"year":2006,"meshHeadings":["Aldehyde Oxidoreductases","Animals","Body Patterning","Cell Death","Cell Proliferation","Fibroblast Growth Factors","Gestational Age","Hedgehog Proteins","Mice","Mice, Knockout","Models, Neurological","Neural Crest","Prosencephalon","Signal Transduction","Telencephalon","Trans-Activators","Tretinoin","Visual Pathways","Vitamin A Deficiency"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Although retinoic acid (RA) has been implicated as one of the diffusible signals regulating forebrain development, patterning of the forebrain has not been analyzed in detail in knockout mouse mutants deficient in embryonic RA synthesis.

Here, we have examined the role of laminin alpha5 (Lama5) in tooth development using laminin alpha5-null mouse primary dental epithelium and tooth germ organ cultures. Lama5-null mice develop a small tooth germ with defective cusp formation and have reduced proliferation of dental epithelium. Also, cell polarity and formation of the monolayer of the inner dental epithelium are disturbed. The enamel knot, a signaling center for tooth germ development, is defective, and there is a significant reduction of Shh and Fgf4 expression in the dental epithelium. In the absence of laminin alpha5, the basement membrane in the inner dental epithelium becomes discontinuous. In normal mice, integrin alpha6beta4, a receptor for laminin alpha5, is strongly localized at the basal layer of the epithelium, whereas in mutant mice, integrin alpha6beta4 is expressed around the cell surface. In primary dental epithelium culture, laminin-10/11 promotes cell growth, spreading, and filopodia-like microspike formation. This promotion is inhibited by anti-integrin alpha6 and beta4 antibodies and by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors and dominant negative Rho-GTPase family proteins Cdc42 and Rac.

Here, we show that loss of beta-catenin results in limb truncations due to a defect in AER maintenance. Stabilization of beta-catenin also results in truncated limbs, caused by a premature regression of the AER. Concomitantly, in these limbs, the expression of Bmp2, Bmp4 and Bmp7, and of the Bmp target genes Msx1, Msx2 and gremlin, is expanded in the mesenchyme. Furthermore, we found that the expression of Lmx1b, a gene exclusively expressed in the dorsal limb mesenchyme and involved in dorsoventral patterning, is reduced upon loss of beta-catenin activity and is expanded ventrally in gain-of-function limbs. However, the known ectodermal regulators Wnt7a and engrailed 1 are expressed normally. This suggests that Lmx1b is also regulated, in part, by a beta-catenin-mediated Wnt signal, independent of the non-canoncial Wnt7a signaling pathway. In addition, loss of beta-catenin results in a severe agenesis of the scapula. Concurrently, the expression of two genes, Pax1 and Emx2, which have been implicated in scapula development, is lost in beta-catenin loss-of-function limbs; however, only Emx2 is upregulated in gain-of-function limbs.

Wnt-4 probably performs this function by activating the Bmp-4 gene encoding a known differentiation factor for smooth muscle cells, since Bmp-4 gene expression was lost in the absence of Wnt-4 while Wnt-4 signaling led to a rescue of Bmp-4 expression and induction of alpha-SMA-positive cells in vitro. Recombinant Bmp-4 similarly rescued the differentiation of alpha-SMA-expressing cells in cultured Wnt-4-deficient embryonic kidney. The lack of smooth muscle cell differentiation leads to an associated deficiency in the pericytes around the developing vessels of the Wnt-4-deficient kidney and apparently leads to a secondary defect in the maturation of the kidney vessels.

Much less is known about the mechanisms that control mid/hindbrain development along the DV axis. Using a conditional mutagenesis approach, we have determined how the ventrally expressed morphogen sonic hedgehog (Shh) directs mid/hindbrain development over time and space through positive regulation of the Gli activators (GliA) and inhibition of the Gli3 repressor (Gli3R). We have discovered that Gli2A-mediated Shh signaling sequentially induces ventral neurons along the medial to lateral axis, and only before midgestation. Unlike in the spinal cord, Shh signaling plays a major role in patterning of dorsal structures (tectum and cerebellum). This function of Shh signaling involves inhibition of Gli3R and continues after midgestation. Gli3R levels also regulate overall growth of the mid/hindbrain region, and this largely involves the suppression of cell death.

Mice lacking either component (Fgfr2b-/- or Fgf10-/-) were examined to determine the role of Fgfr2b-mediated signaling during gastric organogenesis. METHODS: Stomachs from embryonic day 13.5-18.5 Fgfr2b-/-, Fgf10-/-, and wild-type littermates were collected and analyzed by conventional histology, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and electron microscopy. RESULTS: Fgfr2b-/- and Fgf10-/- fetuses had stomachs smaller than wild-type, consisting of relatively proportionate forestomach but disproportionately reduced glandular stomach, the mucosa of which has low cytoarchitectural complexity with a spiral arrangement of large mucosal folds. During mid to late fetal stages (embryonic day 15.5-18.5), epithelial differentiation to mucous and chief cell lineages was rudimentary, with no expression of several early cytodifferentiation markers including GATA4, GATA6, and H+/K+-adenosine triphosphatase and abnormal expression of members of the hedgehog family of signaling molecules.

Distal limb development, in turn, requires a molecular feedback loop between the ZPA expression of sonic hedgehog (Shh) and the apical ectodermal ridge. The TALE homeoprotein Pbx1 has been shown to be essential for proximal limb development. In this study, we first uncover that Pbx1 and Pbx2 are co-expressed in the lateral plate and early limb field mesoderm. Later, Pbx2 is expressed throughout the limb, unlike Pbx1, which is expressed only in the proximal bud. By exploiting a Pbx1/Pbx2 loss-of-function mouse model, we demonstrate that, despite the lack of limb abnormalities in Pbx2-deficient (Pbx2(-/-)) embryos, compound Pbx1(-/-); Pbx2(+/-) mutants, in addition to their exacerbated proximal limb defects, exhibit novel and severe distal abnormalities. Additionally, we reveal that Pbx1(-/-); Pbx2(-/-) embryos lack limbs altogether. Furthermore, we establish that, unlike in flies, where the leg develops independently of Hox and where the Pbx ortholog Exd is required for specification of proximal (but not distal) limbs, in vertebrates, distal limb patterning is Pbx1/Pbx2 dependent. Indeed, we demonstrate that Pbx genetic requirement is mediated, at least in part, through their hierarchical control of Hox spatial distribution and Shh expression. Overall, we establish that, by controlling the spatial expression of Hox genes in the posterior limb and regulating ZPA function, Pbx1/Pbx2 exert a primary hierarchical function on Hox genes, rather than behaving merely as Hox ancillary factors.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"16687132","pmcid":null,"title":"Isl1 is upstream of sonic hedgehog in a pathway required for cardiac morphogenesis.","authors":["Lin L","Bu L","Cai CL","Zhang X","Evans S"],"grantIds":["R01 HL70867","R01 HL74066"],"grantAgencies":["NHLBI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Developmental biology","journalShort":"Dev.

In previous experiments, we showed that Sonic hedgehog treatment of forebrain neural explants results in the activation of Dlx-2 and the novel noncoding RNA (ncRNA), Evf-1. In this report, we show that the Dlx-5/6 ultraconserved region is transcribed to generate an alternatively spliced form of Evf-1, the ncRNA Evf-2.

A stable complex containing the Evf-2 ncRNA and the Dlx-2 protein forms in vivo, suggesting that the Evf-2 ncRNA activates transcriptional activity by directly influencing Dlx-2 activity. These experiments identify a novel mechanism whereby transcription is controlled by the cooperative actions of an ncRNA and a homeodomain protein.

Noggin is expressed dorsally in the closing neural folds and ventrally in the notochord and somites. All Noggin-/- pups are born with lumbar spina bifida; depending on genetic background, they may also have exencephaly. The exencephaly is due to a primary failure of neurulation, resulting from a lack of mid/hindbrain dorsolateral hinge point (DLHP) formation. Thus, as previously shown for Shh signaling at spinal levels, BMP activity may inhibit cranial DLHP morphogenesis. However, the increased BMP signaling observed in the Noggin-/- dorsal neural tube is not sufficient to cause exencephaly; it appears to also depend on the action of a genetic modifier, which may act to increase dorsal Shh signaling. The spinal neural tube defect results from a different mechanism: increased BMP signaling in the mesoderm between the limb buds leads to abnormal somite differentiation and axial skeletal malformation. The resulting lack of mechanical support for the neural tube causes spina bifida. We show that this defect is due to elevated BMP4 signaling.

Recent observations indicate that exogenous administration of Shh can induce angiogenesis and may accelerate repair of ischemic myocardium and skeletal muscle. Because angiogenesis plays a pivotal role in wound repair, we hypothesized that activation of the hedgehog pathway may promote a favorable effect on microvascular remodeling during cutaneous wound healing and thereby accelerate wound closure. Because diabetes is associated with impaired wound healing, we tested this hypothesis in a diabetic model of cutaneous wound repair. METHODS AND RESULTS: In Ptc1-LacZ mice, cutaneous injury resulted in LacZ expression, indicating that expression of the Shh receptor Patched was induced and therefore that the Shh signaling pathway was intact postnatally and upregulated in the process of wound repair. In diabetic mice, topical gene therapy with the use of naked DNA encoding for Shh resulted in significant local gene expression and acceleration of wound recovery. The acceleration in wound healing was notable for increased wound vascularity. In bone marrow transplantation models, the enhanced vascularity of the wound was shown to be mediated, at least in part, by enhanced recruitment of bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells. In vitro, Shh promoted production of angiogenic cytokines from fibroblasts as well as proliferation of dermal fibroblasts. Furthermore, Shh directly promoted endothelial progenitor cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, and tube formation.

Furthermore, in mice lacking LTbeta, all three types of mouse hair were still formed, but all were structurally abnormal.

To identify novel therapeutic targets, we have explored signaling pathways that govern embryonic coronary development. Using a combination of genetically engineered mice and an organ culture system, we identified novel roles for fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and Hedgehog (HH) signaling in coronary vascular development. We show that FGF signals promote coronary growth indirectly by signaling to the cardiomyoblast through redundant function of Fgfr1 and Fgfr2. Myocardial FGF signaling triggers a wave of HH activation that is essential for vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf)-A, Vegf-B, Vegf-C, and angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) expression. We demonstrate that HH is necessary for coronary vascular development and activation of HH signaling is sufficient to promote coronary growth and to rescue coronary defects due to loss of FGF signaling. These studies implicate HH signaling as an essential regulator of coronary vascular development and as a potential therapeutic target for coronary neovascularization.

Although follicles are predominantly epidermal structures, classical tissue recombination experiments indicated that the underlying dermis defines their location during development. Although many molecules involved in hair follicle formation have been identified, the molecular interactions that determine the emergent property of pattern formation have remained elusive. We have used embryonic skin cultures to dissect signaling responses and patterning outcomes as the skin spatially organizes itself. We find that ectodysplasin receptor (Edar)-bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling and transcriptional interactions are central to generation of the primary hair follicle pattern, with restriction of responsiveness, rather than localization of an inducing ligand, being the key driver in this process. The crux of this patterning mechanism is rapid Edar-positive feedback in the epidermis coupled with induction of dermal BMP4/7. The BMPs in turn repress epidermal Edar and hence follicle fate. Edar activation also induces connective tissue growth factor, an inhibitor of BMP signaling, allowing BMP action only at a distance from their site of synthesis. Consistent with this model, transgenic hyperactivation of Edar signaling leads to widespread overproduction of hair follicles. This Edar-BMP activation-inhibition mechanism appears to operate alongside a labile prepattern, suggesting that Edar-mediated stabilization of beta-catenin active foci is a key event in determining definitive follicle locations.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"16788063","pmcid":null,"title":"Loss of Aif function causes cell death in the mouse embryo, but the temporal progression of patterning is normal.","authors":["Brown D","Yu BD","Joza N","Bénit P","Meneses J","Firpo M","Rustin P","Penninger JM","Martin GR"],"grantIds":["R37 HD 25331"],"grantAgencies":["NICHD NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","journalShort":"Proc.

Unexpectedly, we found that both the apoptosis-dependent process of cavitation in embryoid bodies and apoptosis associated with embryonic neural tube closure occur in the absence of AIF, indicating that Aif function is not required for apoptotic cell death in early mouse embryos. By embryonic day 9 (E9), loss of Aif function causes abnormal cell death, presumably because of reduced mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I activity. Because of this cell death, Aif null embryos fail to increase significantly in size after E9. Remarkably, patterning processes continue on an essentially normal schedule, such that E10 Aif null embryos with only approximately 1/10 the normal number of cells have the same somite number as their wild-type littermates.

In Drosophila, Cubitus interruptus (Ci), which mediates hedgehog signaling, regulates gene expression of dpp, the ortholog of mammalian BMP-2. Null mutation of the transcription factor Gli2, a mammalian homolog of Ci, results in severe skeletal abnormalities in mice. We hypothesize that Gli2 regulates BMP-2 gene transcription and thus osteoblast differentiation. In the present study, we show that overexpression of Gli2 enhances BMP-2 promoter activity and mRNA expression in osteoblast precursor cells. In contrast, knocking down Gli2 expression by Gli2 small interfering RNA or genetic ablation of the Gli2 gene results in significant inhibition of BMP-2 gene expression in osteoblasts. Promoter analyses, including chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, provided direct evidence that Gli2 physically interacts with the BMP-2 promoter. Functional studies showed that Gli2 is required for osteoblast maturation in a BMP-2-dependent manner. Finally, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) stimulates BMP-2 promoter activity and osteoblast differentiation, and the effects of Shh are mediated by Gli2. Taken together, these results indicate that Gli2 mediates hedgehog signaling in osteoblasts and is a powerful activator of BMP-2 gene expression, which is required in turn for normal osteoblast differentiation.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"16818446","pmcid":null,"title":"FGF signalling generates ventral telencephalic cells independently of SHH.","authors":["Gutin G","Fernandes M","Palazzolo L","Paek H","Yu K","Ornitz DM","McConnell SK","Hébert JM"],"grantIds":["1R01MH70596","1R21MH075779","MH65261","T32 GM007288"],"grantAgencies":["NIMH NIH HHS","NIMH NIH HHS","NIMH NIH HHS","NIGMS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":12,"month":8,"year":2006,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Body Patterning","Female","Fibroblast Growth Factors","Hedgehog Proteins","Mice","Mice, Knockout","Pregnancy","Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor","Signal Transduction","Telencephalon","Trans-Activators"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Sonic hedgehog (SHH) is required to generate ventral cell types throughout the central nervous system.

We also show that in the absence of Bmp7, fissure formation is not initiated. This absence is associated with a reduced cell proliferation and apoptosis in the proximoventral quadrant of the optic cup, lack of the hyaloid artery, optic nerve aplasia, and intra-retinal misrouting of RGC axons. BMP7 addition to organotypic cultures of optic vesicles from Bmp7-/- embryos rescues Pax2 expression in the ventral region, while follistatin, a BMP7 antagonist, prevents it in early, but not in late, optic vesicle cultures from wild-type embryos. The presence of Pax2-positive cells in late optic cup is instead abolished by interfering with Shh signalling. Furthermore, SHH addition re-establishes Pax2 expression in late optic cups derived from ocular retardation (or) embryos, where optic disc development is impaired owing to the near absence of SHH-producing RGC.

Ptc1 mutations also occur in sporadic forms of BCC and MB. Mutational studies with mice have verified that Ptc1 is a tumor suppressor. We previously identified a second mammalian Patched gene, Ptc2, and demonstrated its distinct expression pattern during embryogenesis, suggesting a unique role in development.

Despite the dynamic expression of Ptc2 during embryogenesis, Ptc2(tm1/tm1) mice are viable, fertile, and apparently normal. Interestingly, adult Ptc2(tm1/tm1) male animals develop skin lesions consisting of alopecia, ulceration, and epidermal hyperplasia.

Morphogenetic processes that occur include the extrusion of midline notochord cells from the epithelial definitive endoderm, the folding of the endoderm into a foregut tube, and the subsequent separation of the foregut tube into trachea and esophagus. Defects in foregut morphogenesis underlie the constellation of human birth defects known as esophageal atresia (EA) and tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF). Here, we review what is known about the cellular events in foregut morphogenesis and the gene mutations associated with EA and TEF in mice and humans. We present new evidence that about 70% of mouse embryos homozygous null for Nog, the gene encoding noggin, a bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) antagonist, have EA/TEF as well as defects in lung branching. This phenotype appears to correlate with abnormal morphogenesis of the notochord and defects in its separation from the definitive endoderm. The abnormalities in foregut and lung morphogenesis of Nog null mutant can be rescued by reducing the gene dose of Bmp4 by 50%. This suggests that normal foregut morphogenesis requires that the level of Bmp4 activity is carefully controlled by means of antagonists such as noggin. Several mechanisms are suggested for how Bmps normally function, including by regulating the intercellular adhesion and behavior of notochord and foregut endoderm cells. Future research must determine how Noggin/Bmp antagonism fits into the network of other factors known to regulate tracheal and esophagus development, both in mouse or humans.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"16935278","pmcid":null,"title":"Indian and sonic hedgehogs regulate synchondrosis growth plate and cranial base development and function.","authors":["Young B","Minugh-Purvis N","Shimo T","St-Jacques B","Iwamoto M","Enomoto-Iwamoto M","Koyama E","Pacifici M"],"grantIds":["AR46000","AR47543","T32EES07282-12"],"grantAgencies":["NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","PHS HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Developmental biology","journalShort":"Dev.

The Ihh(-/-) cranial bases displayed reduced growth and chondrocyte proliferation, but chondrocyte hypertrophy was widespread. Rather than forming a typical narrow zone, Ihh(-/-) hypertrophic chondrocytes occupied an elongated central portion of each growth plate and were flanked by immature collagen II-expressing chondrocytes facing perichondrial tissues. Endochondral ossification was delayed in much of the Ihh(-/-) cranial bases but, surprisingly, was unaffected most posteriorly. Searching for an explanation, we found that notochord remnants near incipient spheno-occipital synchondroses at E13.5 expressed Sonic hedgehog and local chondrocytes expressed Patched, suggesting that Shh had sustained chondrocyte maturation and occipital ossification. Equally unexpected, Ihh(-/-) growth plates stained poorly with Alcian blue and contained low aggrecan transcript levels. A comparable difference was seen in cultured wild-type versus Ihh(-/-) synchondrosis chondrocytes. Treatment with exogenous Ihh did not fully restore normal proteoglycan levels in mutant cultures, but a combination of Ihh and BMP-2 did. In summary, Ihh is required for multiple processes during synchondrosis and cranial base development, including growth plate zone organization, chondrocyte orientation, and proteoglycan production.

We combine mouse genetics with experimental manipulation of signalling to analyze the kinetics by which the SHH morphogen and the BMP antagonist gremlin 1 (GREM1) control gene expression in the digit-forming mesenchyme of mouse limb buds. Although most mesenchymal cells respond rapidly to SHH signalling, the transcriptional upregulation of specific SHH target signals in the mesenchyme occurs with differential temporal kinetics and in a spatially restricted fashion. In particular, the expression of the BMP antagonist Grem1 is always upregulated in mesenchymal cells located distal to the SHH source and acts upstream of FGF signalling by the apical ectodermal ridge. GREM1/FGF-mediated feedback signalling is, in turn, required to propagate SHH and establish the presumptive digit expression domains of the Notch ligand jagged 1 (Jag1) and 5'Hoxd genes in the distal limb bud mesenchyme. Their establishment is significantly delayed in Grem1-deficient limb buds and cannot be rescued by specific restoration of SHH signalling in mutant limb buds. This shows that GREM1/FGF feedback signalling is required for regulation of the temporal kinetics of the mesenchymal response to SHH signalling. Finally, inhibition of SHH signal transduction at distinct time points reveals the differential temporal dependence of Grem1, Jag1 and 5'Hoxd gene expression on SHH signalling. In particular, the expression of Hoxd13 depends on SHH signal transduction significantly longer than does Hoxd11 expression, revealing that the reverse co-linear establishment, but not maintenance of their presumptive digit expression domains, depends on SHH signalling.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"16943282","pmcid":null,"title":"Man1, an inner nuclear membrane protein, regulates vascular remodeling by modulating transforming growth factor beta signaling.","authors":["Ishimura A","Ng JK","Taira M","Young SG","Osada S"],"grantIds":["HL66590","HL66600","HL66621"],"grantAgencies":["NHLBI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS","NHLBI NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":13,"month":10,"year":2006,"meshHeadings":["Activins","Animals","Blood Vessels","Cell Nucleus","Cell Survival","Embryo, Mammalian","Embryo, Nonmammalian","Genes, Lethal","Membrane Proteins","Mice","Mice, Mutant Strains","Mutation","Neovascularization, Physiologic","Nodal Protein","Nuclear Envelope","Nuclear Proteins","Sequence Deletion","Smad2 Protein","Smad3 Protein","Transforming Growth Factor beta","Transforming Growth Factor beta1","Up-Regulation","Xenopus","Xenopus Proteins"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"A growing number of integral inner nuclear membrane (INM) proteins have been implicated in diverse cellular functions.

We have also showed that the recruitment of mural cells to the vascular wall is severely disturbed in mutants, which may lead to disruption of intercellular communication between endothelial and mural cells required for proper vascular remodeling.

Our work unravels for the first time the pivotal role of FGF10 in the survival and proliferation of the colonic epithelium, biological activities which are essential for colonic crypt formation.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"16971467","pmcid":null,"title":"Zinc-finger genes Fez and Fez-like function in the establishment of diencephalon subdivisions.","authors":["Hirata T","Nakazawa M","Muraoka O","Nakayama R","Suda Y","Hibi M"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":29,"month":10,"year":2006,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Body Patterning","DNA-Binding Proteins","Diencephalon","Enhancer Elements, Genetic","Gene Expression","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Homeodomain Proteins","Mice","Mice, Transgenic","Nerve Tissue Proteins","Promoter Regions, Genetic","Transcription Factors","Zinc Fingers"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Fez and Fez-like (Fezl) are zinc-finger genes that encode transcriptional repressors expressed in overlapping domains of the forebrain.

The caudal forebrain can be divided into three transverse subdivisions: prethalamus (also called ventral thalamus), thalamus (dorsal thalamus) and pretectum. Fez;Fezl-deficient mice showed a complete loss of prethalamus and a strong reduction of the thalamus at late gestation periods. Genetic marker analyses revealed that during early diencephalon patterning in Fez;Fezl-deficient mice, the rostral diencephalon (prospective prethalamus) did not form and the caudal diencephalon (prospective thalamus and pretectum) expanded rostrally. Fez;Fezl-deficient mice also displayed defects in the formation of the zona limitans intrathalamica (ZLI), which is located on the boundary between the prethalamus and thalamus. Fez and Fezl are expressed in the region rostral to the rostral limit of Irx1 expression, which marks the prospective position of the ZLI. Transgene-mediated misexpression of Fezl or Fez caudal to the ZLI repressed the caudal diencephalon fate and affected the formation of the Shh-expressing ZLI. These data indicate that Fez and Fezl repress the caudal diencephalon fate in the rostral diencephalon, and ZLI formation probably depends on Fez/Fezl-mediated formation of diencephalon subdivisions.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"16989801","pmcid":null,"title":"Pitx1 determines the morphology of muscle, tendon, and bones of the hindlimb.","authors":["DeLaurier A","Schweitzer R","Logan M"],"grantIds":["MC_U117560477"],"grantAgencies":["Medical Research Council"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Developmental biology","journalShort":"Dev.

To explore the roles of Pitx1 and Tbx4 in patterning the hindlimb, we have ectopically misexpressed these genes in the mouse forelimb using transgenic methods. We have developed a novel technique for visualising the structure and organisation of tissues in limbs in 3D using optical projection tomography (OPT).

Misexpression of Pitx1 in the forelimb results in the transformation and translocation of specific muscles, tendons, and bones of the forelimb so that they acquire a hindlimb-like morphology. Pitx1 also upregulates hindlimb-specific factors in the forelimb, including Hoxc10 and Tbx4.

This graded expression correlates with the (severe)dorsal-to-(mild)ventral telencephalic phenotype observed in Gli3(Xt/Xt) mice. We characterized the abnormal joining of the telencephalon to the diencephalon and defined the medial limit of the dorsal telencephalon in Gli3(Xt/Xt) mice early in corticogenesis.

We observed occasional cells with diencephalic character in the Foxg1 (forkhead box)-expressing Gli3(Xt/Xt) telencephalon at embryonic day 10.5, a day after the anatomical subdivision of the forebrain vesicle. Large clusters of such cells appear in the Gli3(Xt/Xt) neocortical region at later ages, when the neocortex becomes highly disorganized, forming rosettes comprising mainly neural progenitors.

Consequently, Wnt/beta-catenin signaling was suppressed in Smad7 transgenic hair follicles.

In grafting experiments, ectopic vascular cells influence the localisation of thyroid tissue cell non-autonomously, showing that vessels provide guidance cues in zebrafish thyroid morphogenesis. In mouse thyroid development, the midline primordium bifurcates and two lobes relocalise cranially along the bilateral pair of carotid arteries. In hedgehog-deficient mice, thyroid tissue always develops along the ectopically and asymmetrically positioned carotid arteries, suggesting that, in mice (as in zebrafish), co-developing major arteries define the position of the thyroid. The similarity between zebrafish and mouse mutant phenotypes further indicates that thyroid relocalisation involves two morphogenetic phases, and that variation in the second phase accounts for species-specific differences in thyroid morphology.

This number of ventral defects is identical to bladder exstrophy, a congenital anomaly exhibited in human neonates. In the absence of p63, the ventral urothelium was neither committed nor differentiated, whereas the dorsal urothelium was both committed and differentiated. Furthermore, in p63-/- bladders, apoptosis in the ventral urothelium was significantly increased. This was accompanied by the upregulation of mitochondrial apoptotic mediators Bax and Apaf1, and concurrent upregulation of p53.

We demonstrate expression of Ptch1 in allantoic mesoderm of the placenta from wild-type mid-gestation embryos.

However, the role of Gli2 and Gli3 in ventral hindbrain development is unclear. In this paper, we have examined DV patterning of the hindbrain of Shh(-/-), Gli2(-/-) and Gli3(-/-) embryos, and found that the respective role of Gli2 and Gli3 is not only different between the hindbrain and spinal cord, but also at distinct rostrocaudal levels of the hindbrain. Remarkably, the anterior hindbrain of Gli2(-/-) embryos displays ventral patterning defects as severe as those observed in Shh(-/-) embryos suggesting that, unlike in the spinal cord and posterior hindbrain, Gli3 cannot compensate for the loss of Gli2 activator function in Shh-dependent ventral patterning of the anterior hindbrain. Loss of Gli3 also results in a distinct patterning defect in the anterior hindbrain, including dorsal expansion of Nkx6.1 expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ventral patterning of rhombomere 4 is less affected by loss of Gli2 function revealing a different requirement for Gli proteins in this rhombomere.

The striking similarities between beta1 integrin-deleted mice and neonatal mice with defective Hedgehog signaling led to the discovery that Hedgehog expression was markedly reduced in the former mice. beta1 integrins were found to drive the expression of Hedgehogs in intestinal epithelial cells in an HNF-3beta (Foxa2)-dependent fashion.

The defects occur through a gain-of-function mechanism and penetrance is dependent on agrin dosage. The agrin-induced developmental defects are highly variable, and include anophthalmia, persistence of vitreous vessels, and fusion of anterior chamber structures. A frequently observed defect is an optic stalk coloboma leading to the misdifferentiation of the optic stalk as retina, which becomes continuous with the forebrain. The defects in optic-stalk differentiation correlate with reduced sonic hedgehog immunoreactivity and overexpansion of the PAX6 domain from the retina into the optic stalk. The ocular phenotypes associated with agrin overexpression are dependent on genetic background, occurring with high penetrance in inbred C57BL/6J mice. Distinct loci sensitizing C57BL/6J mice to agrin-induced dysgenesis were identified.

Two strategies were used to functionally demonstrate that decreasing retinoid levels can reverse Por(-/-) phenotypic defects, (i) by culturing Por(-/-) embryos in defined serum-free medium, and (ii) by generating compound mutants defective in RA synthesis due to haploinsufficiency of the retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (Raldh2) gene. Both approaches clearly improved the Por(-/-) early phenotype, the latter allowing mutants to be recovered up until E13.5. Abnormal brain patterning, with posteriorization of hindbrain cell fates and defective mid- and forebrain development and vascular defects were rescued in E9.5 Por(-/-) embryos. E13.5 Por(-/-); Raldh2(+/-) embryos exhibited abdominal/caudal and limb defects that strikingly phenocopy those of Cyp26a1(-/-) and Cyp26b1(-/-) mutants, respectively. Por(-/-); Raldh2(+/-) limb buds were truncated and proximalized and the anterior-posterior patterning system was not established. Thus, POR function is indispensable for the proper regulation of RA levels and tissue distribution not only during early embryonic development but also in later morphogenesis and molecular patterning of the brain, abdominal/caudal region and limbs.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"17194222","pmcid":"1713256","title":"Genetic analysis of the roles of BMP2, BMP4, and BMP7 in limb patterning and skeletogenesis.","authors":["Bandyopadhyay A","Tsuji K","Cox K","Harfe BD","Rosen V","Tabin CJ"],"grantIds":["P01 DK56246"],"grantAgencies":["NIDDK NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"PLoS genetics","journalShort":"PLoS Genet.","day":9,"month":12,"year":2006,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Body Patterning","Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2","Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4","Bone Morphogenetic Protein 7","Bone Morphogenetic Proteins","Chondrogenesis","Down-Regulation","Extremities","Female","Homeodomain Proteins","Limb Deformities, Congenital","Male","Mice","Mice, Knockout","Mice, Transgenic","Osteogenesis","Signal Transduction","Transforming Growth Factor beta"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family members, including BMP2, BMP4, and BMP7, are expressed throughout limb development.

However, due to complications associated with early embryonic lethality, particularly for Bmp2 and Bmp4, and with functional redundancy among BMP molecules, it has been difficult to decipher the specific roles of these BMP molecules during different stages of limb development. To circumvent these issues, we have constructed a series of mouse strains lacking one or more of these BMPs, using conditional alleles in the case of Bmp2 and Bmp4 to remove them specifically from the limb bud mesenchyme. Contrary to earlier suggestions, our results indicate that BMPs neither act as secondary signals downstream of Sonic Hedghog (SHH) in patterning the anteroposterior axis nor as signals from the interdigital mesenchyme in specifying digit identity. We do find that a threshold level of BMP signaling is required for the onset of chondrogenesis, and hence some chondrogenic condensations fail to form in limbs deficient in both BMP2 and BMP4. However, in the condensations that do form, subsequent chondrogenic differentiation proceeds normally even in the absence of BMP2 and BMP7 or BMP2 and BMP4.

Embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation toward pancreatic insulin-producing cells offers such perspectives, but there are still many challenges to overcome. Our previous studies suggested that the limited amount of insulin-positive cells derived from ES cells is related to the activation of pancreas inhibitory signals. To confirm this hypothesis, we report here that exposure of mouse embryonic pancreas explants to soluble factors from embryoid bodies (EBs) inhibits growth, morphogenesis, and endocrine and exocrine differentiation as evaluated by explant size and mRNA and protein expression. Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), an established pancreas repressor both at early and late developmental stages, was produced and secreted by EBs, and participated in the inhibitory effect by inducing its target Gli1 in the explants. Inhibition of Hedgehog pathway rescued the differentiation of Insulin-positive cells in the explants. In contrast to pancreatic cells, hepatic progenitors exposed to EB-conditioned medium showed improved differentiation of albumin-positive cells. In a model system of ES cell differentiation in vitro, we found that definitive endoderm induction by serum removal or activin A treatment further increased Hedgehog production and activity in EBs. Concomitantly, downregulation of the pancreas marker Pdx1 was recorded in activin-treated EBs, a phenomenon that was prevented by antagonizing Hedgehog signaling with Hedgehog interacting protein. These data strongly suggest that Hedgehog production in EBs limits pancreatic fate acquisition and forms a major obstacle in the specification of pancreatic cells from ES-derived definitive endoderm.

While it is known that sonic hedgehog (Shh) is expressed by the cloacal epithelia, the developmental programs that regulate and coordinate the formation of the urogenital and reproductive organs have not been elucidated. Here we report that Shh mutant embryos display hypoplasia of external genitalia, internal urethra (pelvic urethra) and bladder. The importance of Shh signaling in the development of bladder and external genitalia was confirmed by analyzing a variety of mutant mouse lines with defective hedgehog signaling. By genetically labeling hedgehog-responding tissue lineages adjacent to the cloaca and urogenital sinus, we defined the contribution of these tissues to the bladder and external genitalia. We discovered that development of smooth muscle myosin-positive embryonic bladder mesenchyme requires Shh signaling, and that the bladder mesenchyme and dorsal (upper) external genitalia derive from Shh-responsive peri-cloacal mesenchyme. Thus, the mesenchymal precursors for multiple urogenital structures derive from peri-cloacal mesenchyme and the coordination of urogenital organ formation from these precursors is orchestrated by Shh signals.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"17207476","pmcid":null,"title":"Role of retinoic acid during forebrain development begins late when Raldh3 generates retinoic acid in the ventral subventricular zone.","authors":["Molotkova N","Molotkov A","Duester G"],"grantIds":["EY 013969","GM 062848","R01 EY013969","R01 EY013969-04","R01 GM062848","R01 GM062848-04"],"grantAgencies":["NEI NIH HHS","NIGMS NIH HHS","NEI NIH HHS","NEI NIH HHS","NIGMS NIH HHS","NIGMS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Developmental biology","journalShort":"Dev.

Furthermore, Raldh3 is expressed later in the forebrain itself (lateral ganglionic eminence; LGE) starting at E12.5, suggesting a later role in forebrain neurogenesis. Here we have analyzed mouse embryos carrying single or double null mutations in Raldh2 and Raldh3 for defects in forebrain development. Raldh2(-/-);Raldh3(-/-) embryos completely lacked RA signaling activity in the early forebrain, but exhibited relatively normal expression of Fgf8, Shh, and Meis2 in the forebrain. Thus, we find no clear requirement for RA in controlling expression of these important forebrain patterning genes, but Raldh3 expression in the frontonasal surface ectoderm was found to be needed for normal Fgf8 expression in the olfactory pit. Our studies revealed that later expression of Raldh3 in the subventricular zone of the LGE is required for RA signaling activity in the ventral forebrain.

Later (E13.5) loss of Mi-2beta in the dorsal epidermis does not interfere with suprabasal layer differentiation or maintenance of the basal layer, but induction of hair follicles is blocked. After initiation of the follicle, some subsequent morphogenesis of the hair peg may proceed in the absence of Mi-2beta, but production of the progenitors that give rise to the inner layers of the hair follicle and hair shaft is impaired. These results suggest that the extended self-renewal capacity of epidermal precursors arises early during embryogenesis by a process that is critically dependent on Mi-2beta.

Noggin is expressed in the ventral diencephalon during Rathke's pouch induction, in the underlying cartilage plate during cell specification and in the adult anterior pituitary gland. Noggin null embryos have a variable pituitary phenotype, which ranges from a rostrally displaced Rathke's pouch to induction of secondary pituitary tissue.

We further show that Shh protects pancreatic duct epithelial cells from apoptosis through the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling and the stabilization of Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L). Significantly, Shh also cooperates with activated K-Ras to promote pancreatic tumor development. Finally, Shh signaling enhances K-Ras-induced pancreatic tumorigenesis by reducing the dependence of tumor cells on the sustained activation of the MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways. Thus, our data suggest that Shh signaling contributes to tumor initiation in the pancreas through at least two mechanisms and additionally enhances tumor cell resistance to therapeutic intervention.

Little is known about the role of intracellular regulation of the TGF-beta pathway in development. E3 ubiquitin ligases target specific protein substrates for proteasome-mediated degradation, and several are implicated in signaling. We have shown that Arkadia, a nuclear RING-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase, is essential for a subset of Nodal functions in the embryo, but the molecular mechanism of its action in embryonic cells had not been addressed. Here, we find that Arkadia facilitates Nodal signaling broadly in the embryo, and that it is indispensable for cell fates that depend on maximum signaling. Loss of Arkadia in embryonic cells causes nuclear accumulation of phospho-Smad2/3 (P-Smad2/3), the effectors of Nodal signaling; however, these must be repressed or hypoactive as the expression of their direct target genes is reduced or lost. Molecular and functional analysis shows that Arkadia interacts with and ubiquitinates P-Smad2/3 causing their degradation, and that this is via the same domains required for enhancing their activity. Consistent with this dual function, introduction of Arkadia in homozygous null (-/-) embryonic stem cells activates the accumulated and hypoactive P-Smad2/3 at the expense of their abundance. Arkadia-/- cells, like Smad2-/- cells, cannot form foregut and prechordal plate in chimeras, confirming this functional interaction in vivo. As Arkadia overexpression never represses, and in some cells enhances signaling, the degradation of P-Smad2/3 by Arkadia cannot occur prior to their activation in the nucleus. Therefore, Arkadia provides a mechanism for signaling termination at the end of the cascade by coupling degradation of P-Smad2/3 with the activation of target gene transcription. This mechanism can account for achieving efficient and maximum Nodal signaling during embryogenesis and for rapid resetting of target gene promoters allowing cells to respond to dynamic changes in extracellular signals.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"17360777","pmcid":null,"title":"Activities of N-Myc in the developing limb link control of skeletal size with digit separation.","authors":["Ota S","Zhou ZQ","Keene DR","Knoepfler P","Hurlin PJ"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":23,"month":4,"year":2007,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Apoptosis","Bone and Bones","Cell Differentiation","Cell Proliferation","DNA-Binding Proteins","Extremities","Homeodomain Proteins","Limb Deformities, Congenital","Mesoderm","Mice","Mice, Knockout","Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc","Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2","Syndactyly"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"The developing limb serves as a paradigm for studying pattern formation and morphogenetic cell death.

Although Myc family proteins have pro-apoptotic activity, N-Myc is not expressed in interdigital cells undergoing programmed cell death. We provide evidence indicating that the lack of interdigital cell death and associated syndactyly is related to an absence of interdigital cells marked by expression of Fgfr2 and Msx2. Thus, instead of directly regulating interdigital cell death, we propose that N-Myc is required for the proper generation of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells that become localized to interdigital regions and trigger digit separation when eliminated by programmed cell death.

Gli3R acts by antagonizing active forms of the Wnt transcriptional effector, beta-catenin. Consistent with this, Gli3R appears to physically interact with the carboxy-terminal domain of beta-catenin, a region that includes the transactivation domain.

Reconstitution with a wild-type placenta rescues the early lethality, but mutant embryos still succumb to cardiovascular and hematopoietic defects. In addition, mutant embryos demonstrate a profound defect in lung branching morphogenesis associated with striking up-regulation of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) antagonist Sprouty-2 and abnormal localization of MAPK activity within the lung epithelium. This defect can be significantly suppressed by lentiviral short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of Sprouty-2 in vivo. Furthermore, in the context of K-rasG12D-mediated lung tumorigenesis, Sprouty-2 is also up-regulated and functions as a tumor suppressor to limit tumor number and overall tumor burden.

Analysis of the 3rd pouch-derived primordium in Gcm2-/- mutants showed the parathyroid-specific domain was present before E12.5 but underwent programmed cell death between E12 and 12.5.

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which Shh regulates inner ear development, we examined embryos with various combinations of mutant alleles for Shh, Gli2 and Gli3. Our study shows that Gli3 repressor (R) is required for patterning dorsal inner ear structures, whereas Gli activator (A) proteins are essential for ventral inner ear structures. A proper balance of Gli3R and Gli2/3A is required along the length of the dorsoventral axis of the inner ear to mediate graded levels of Shh signaling, emanating from ventral midline tissues. Formation of the ventral-most otic region, the distal cochlear duct, requires robust Gli2/3A function. By contrast, the formation of the proximal cochlear duct and saccule, which requires less Shh signaling, is achieved by antagonizing Gli3R. The dorsal vestibular region requires the least amount of Shh signaling in order to generate the correct dose of Gli3R required for the development of this otic region. Taken together, our data suggest that reciprocal gradients of GliA and GliR mediate the responses to Shh signaling along the dorsoventral axis of the inner ear.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"17376812","pmcid":null,"title":"Multiple functions of Snail family genes during palate development in mice.","authors":["Murray SA","Oram KF","Gridley T"],"grantIds":["CA034196","HD034883"],"grantAgencies":["NCI NIH HHS","NICHD NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":16,"month":5,"year":2007,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Cleft Palate","Embryo, Mammalian","Female","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Male","Mandible","Mice","Mice, Knockout","Neural Crest","Palate","Transcription Factors"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Palate development requires precise regulation of gene expression changes, morphogenetic movements and alterations in cell physiology.

To elucidate its fundamental principles, the hair follicle is an attractive model due to its easy accessibility and dispensability. Hair follicle asymmetry is evident from its angling and the localization of associated structures. However, axial patterning is not restricted to the follicle itself but also generates rotational hair shaft asymmetry which, for zigzag hairs, generates 3-4 bends that alternately point into opposite directions. Here we show by analyzing mutant and transgenic mice that WNT and ectodysplasin signaling are involved in the control of the molecular and morphological asymmetry of the follicle and the associated hair shaft, respectively. Asymmetry is affected by polarized WNT and ectodysplasin signaling in mature hair follicles. When endogenous signaling is impaired, molecular asymmetry is lost and mice no longer form zigzag hairs. Both signaling pathways affect the polarized expression of Shh which likely functions as a directional reference for hair shaft production in all follicles. We propose that this regulatory pathway also establishes follicular asymmetry during morphogenesis. Moreover, the identified molecular hierarchy offers a model for the periodic patterning of zigzag hairs mechanistically similar to mesodermal segmentation.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"17442700","pmcid":null,"title":"Genomic characterization of Gli-activator targets in sonic hedgehog-mediated neural patterning.","authors":["Vokes SA","Ji H","McCuine S","Tenzen T","Giles S","Zhong S","Longabaugh WJ","Davidson EH","Wong WH","McMahon AP"],"grantIds":["HG3903-01","R01 GM67250","R37 NS033642"],"grantAgencies":["NHGRI NIH HHS","NIGMS NIH HHS","NINDS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":1,"month":5,"year":2007,"meshHeadings":["Amino Acid Motifs","Animals","Body Patterning","Chromatin Immunoprecipitation","Epitopes","Gene Expression Profiling","Genome","Hedgehog Proteins","Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors","Mice","Mice, Transgenic","NIH 3T3 Cells","Neurons","Stem Cells"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Sonic hedgehog (Shh) acts as a morphogen to mediate the specification of distinct cell identities in the ventral neural tube through a Gli-mediated (Gli1-3) transcriptional network.

Here we demonstrate that netrin-1-mediated commissural axon guidance requires cell-autonomous expression of HS in commissural neurons in vivo. We used the Wnt1-Cre transgene to drive region-specific ablation of Ext1, which encodes an enzyme essential for HS synthesis, in the dorsal part of the spinal cord.

Neither Ext1-deficient dorsal spinal cord explants nor wild-type explants in which HS expression was ablated could extend axons in response to netrin-1. Intracellular signaling downstream of netrin-1 and DCC was defective in Ext1-deficient commissural neurons and in DCC-transfected HEK293T cells from which HS was removed.

The binding of PN-1 to LRPs interferes with SHH-induced cyclin D1 expression. CGNPs isolated from Pn-1-deficient mice exhibit enhanced basal proliferation rates due to overactivation of the SHH pathway and show higher sensitivity to exogenous SHH. In vivo, the Pn-1 deficiency alters the expression of SHH target genes. In addition, the onset of CGNP differentiation is delayed, which results in an enlarged outer external granular layer.

The second oxidation step, the conversion of retinal to RA, is performed by retinaldehyde dehydrogenases. Thus, the specific spatiotemporal distribution of retinoid synthesis is believed to be controlled exclusively at the level of the second oxidation reaction. In an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced forward genetic screen we discovered a new midgestation lethal mouse mutant, called trex, which displays craniofacial, limb, and organ abnormalities.

Genes in the Shh pathway and SM expression in mouse embryonic (E) bladders (E12.5, 13.5, and 14.5) were examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC), in situ hybridization, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). To examine the effects of disrupting Shh signaling, bladder tissues were isolated at E12.5 and E14.5, that is, before and after bladder SM induction. The embryonic bladders were cultured on membranes floating on medium with and without 10 muM of cyclopamine, an Shh inhibitor. After 3 days, SM expression was examined by assessing the following: SM alpha-actin (SMAA), SM gamma-actin (SMGA), SM-myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC), Patched, GLI1, bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) by IHC and RT-PCR. SM-related genes and proteins were not expressed in E12.5 mouse embryonic bladder before SM differentiation, but were expressed by E13.5 when SM differentiation was initiated. Shh was expressed in the urothelium in E12.5 bladders. Shh-related gene expression at E12.5 was significantly higher than at E14.5.

Here, we examined the capacity of Shh lacking the cholesterol moiety (ShhN) to pattern different cell types in the telencephalon and spinal cord. In mice expressing ShhN, we detected low-level ShhN in the prechordal plate and notochord, consistent with the notion that ShhN can rapidly spread from its site of synthesis.

Our findings indicate an essential role for the cholesterol moiety in restricting Shh dilution and deregulated spread for patterning the telencephalon.

Two evolutionarily conserved spliceforms, Fgf8a and Fgf8b, exhibit distinct bioactivities, with Fgf8b having a more potent inductive activity due to higher affinity for Fgf receptors. To investigate the in vivo requirement for Fgf8b, we created a splice-site mutation abolishing Fgf8b expression in mice. Analysis of this mutant has uncovered a novel function of Fgf8 signaling before the onset of gastrulation. We show that the loss of Fgf8b disrupts the induction of the brachyury gene in the pregastrular embryo and, in addition, disrupts the proper alignment of the anteroposterior axis with the shape of the embryo and the uterine axes at embryonic day (E) 6.5. Importantly, Fgf8-null embryos display the same phenotype as Fgf8b-deficient embryos at E6.5, demonstrating that signaling by Fgf8b is specifically required for development of the pregastrular embryo. By contrast, during gastrulation, Fgf8a can partially compensate for the loss of Fgf8b in mesoderm specification. We show that an increased level of Fgf8a expression, which leads to Fgf4 expression in the primitive streak, can also promote mesoderm migration in the absence of Fgf8b. Therefore, different Fgf signals may have distinct requirements for the morphogenesis and gene regulation before and during gastrulation. Importantly, our findings implicate Fgf8 in the morphogenetic process that establishes the defined relationship between the axes of the embryo and the uterus at the beginning of gastrulation, a perplexing phenomenon discovered two decades ago.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"17452023","pmcid":null,"title":"A high-resolution anatomical ontology of the developing murine genitourinary tract.","authors":["Little MH","Brennan J","Georgas K","Davies JA","Davidson DR","Baldock RA","Beverdam A","Bertram JF","Capel B","Chiu HS","Clements D","Cullen-McEwen L","Fleming J","Gilbert T","Herzlinger D","Houghton D","Kaufman MH","Kleymenova E","Koopman PA","Lewis AG","McMahon AP","Mendelsohn CL","Mitchell EK","Rumballe BA","Sweeney DE","Valerius MT","Yamada G","Yang Y","Yu J"],"grantIds":["DK070136-02","DK070181","DK07020001","MC_U127527203","R01 DK061459","R01 DK061459-01A1","R01 DK061459-01A1S1","R01 DK061459-02","R01 DK061459-03","R01 DK061459-04","R01 DK061459-05","R01 DK061459-06","R01 DK061459-07","R01 DK061459-07S1","R01 DK061459-08","R01 DK061459-09","R56 DK082963","R56 DK082963-01","U01 DK070136","U01 DK070136-02","U01 DK070181","U01 DK070181-03","U01 DK070200-01"],"grantAgencies":["NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","Medical Research Council","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS","NIDDK NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Gene expression patterns : GEP","journalShort":"Gene Expr.

Analysis of the Gli zinc-finger transcription factors, primary mediators of Shh activity, demonstrated differential induction between models of pathway activation.

Thus, our data demonstrate that Ptc(+/-) mice have an expanded progenitor cell niche in vivo and that NSCs maintain a cell-intrinsic increase in basal proliferation in vitro that is sustained by a Gli transduction signature distinct from that of exogenous Shh stimulation.

GLI3 belongs to the GLI family of transcription factors that mediates extracellular Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signals. In the absence of SHH signals, GLI3 is processed to form a transcriptional repressor termed GLI3R. During early limb development, the regulation of GLI3 processing by SHH is decisive in determining the correct number and identity of digits. Analyses of mouse embryos have produced evidence that elevated levels of GLI3R reduce the number of developing digits. Remarkably, PHS causative mutations are predicted to produce a truncated protein similar to the endogenous GLI3R. Nevertheless, polydactyly is frequently observed in PHS patients and it even represents a criterion for the clinical diagnosis of PHS. In order to detect the underlying cause of this obvious discrepancy, we made use of the Gli3(Delta699) mouse mutant, which represents the mouse model of PHS. We show that the mutant murine allele gives rise to a truncated version of GLI3 that mimicks both the processed GLI3R isoform and the proposed pathogenic GLI3(PHS) protein. We analyzed how the mutant GLI3 protein interferes with the anteroposterior patterning of early limb development, whereas processes that are associated with the outgrowth of the limb bud remain remarkably unimpaired.

In vertebrates, this process acts as a pro-survival or pro-death mechanism in different physiological and pathological conditions, such as neurodegeneration and cancer; however, the roles of autophagy during embryonic development are still largely uncharacterized. Beclin1 (Becn1; coiled-coil, myosin-like BCL2-interacting protein) is a principal regulator in autophagosome formation, and its deficiency results in early embryonic lethality.

We found that Ambra1 is a positive regulator of the Becn1-dependent programme of autophagy, as revealed by its overexpression and by RNA interference experiments in vitro. Notably, Ambra1 functional deficiency in mouse embryos leads to severe neural tube defects associated with autophagy impairment, accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, unbalanced cell proliferation and excessive apoptotic cell death.

Recently, it has been suggested that mesencephalic floor plate (FP) cells acquire neural progenitor characteristics to generate mesDA neurons. Here, we directly examined this in a fate mapping experiment using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) with an FP cell-specific surface marker, and demonstrate that mesencephalic FP cells have neurogenic activity and generate mesDA neurons in vitro. By contrast, sorted caudal FP cells have no neurogenic potential, as previously thought. Analysis of dreher mutant mice carrying a mutation in the Lmx1a locus and transgenic mice ectopically expressing Otx2 in caudal FP cells demonstrated that Otx2 determines anterior identity that confers neurogenic activity to FP cells and specifies a mesDA fate, at least in part through the induction of Lmx1a. We further show that FACS can isolate mesDA progenitors, a suitable transplantation material, from embryonic stem cell-derived neural cells. Our data provide insights into the mechanisms of specification and generation of mesDA neurons, and illustrate a useful cell replacement approach for Parkinson's disease.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"17681174","pmcid":null,"title":"Phases of canonical Wnt signaling during the development of mouse intestinal epithelium.","authors":["Kim BM","Mao J","Taketo MM","Shivdasani RA"],"grantIds":["R01DK61139"],"grantAgencies":["NIDDK NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Gastroenterology","journalShort":"Gastroenterology","day":7,"month":8,"year":2007,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Antigens, CD44","Axin Protein","Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors","Cell Differentiation","Cell Proliferation","Cyclin D","Cyclins","Cytoskeletal Proteins","Embryonic Stem Cells","Epithelial Cells","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Genes, Reporter","Hedgehog Proteins","Intestinal Mucosa","Mice","Mice, Transgenic","Microvilli","Nerve Tissue Proteins","Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc","RNA, Messenger","Signal Transduction","TCF Transcription Factors","Time Factors","Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein","Wnt Proteins","beta Catenin","beta-Galactosidase"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Intestinal crypts constitute a niche in which epithelial progenitors respond to Wnt signals, replicate, and prepare to differentiate. Because mutations in Wnt pathway genes lead to intestinal cancer, the role of Wnt signaling in gut epithelial homeostasis is a subject of intense investigation. We studied how Wnt signaling is established during intestine development. METHODS: We studied spatiotemporal features of Wnt signaling at formative stages in mouse embryos, when villous projections appear and crypt precursors occupy intervillus regions. We used TOP-GAL transgenic and Axin2(LacZ) mice, which report faithfully on canonical Wnt activity, relevant molecular markers, and embryos with aberrant beta-catenin activation. RESULTS: Developing intestines first display evidence for Wnt signaling after appearance of villi. During villus morphogenesis, intervillus cells proliferate actively but lack signs of canonical Wnt signaling. Surprisingly, in late gestation and briefly thereafter, conspicuous Wnt activity is evident in differentiated, postmitotic villus epithelium. Neither Tcf4, a principal transcriptional effector of intestinal Wnt signals, nor candidate Wnt targets CD44 and cyclinD1 are expressed in late fetal villus cells that show high Wnt activity. Instead, those cells express the related factor Tcf3 and a different Wnt target, c-Myc. Premature and deregulated beta-catenin activation causes severe villus dysmorphogenesis in transgenic mice. CONCLUSIONS: Relationships among Wnt signaling, epithelial proliferation, and tissue differentiation are reversed in the developing and adult gut. The canonical Wnt pathway has independent, albeit possibly overlapping, functions in early intestinal villi and adult crypts. These observations advance understanding of Wnt functions in intestinal development and disease.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"17610861","pmcid":null,"title":"Extended exposure to Sonic hedgehog is required for patterning the posterior digits of the vertebrate limb.","authors":["Scherz PJ","McGlinn E","Nissim S","Tabin CJ"],"grantIds":["R37 HD032443","R37 HD032443-13","R37 HD32443"],"grantAgencies":["NICHD NIH HHS","NICHD NIH HHS","NICHD NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Developmental biology","journalShort":"Dev.

Although the anterior digits appear to be specified by differential concentrations of Shh in a traditional, morphogen-like response, recent studies have suggested that posterior digits are specified by an extended time of exposure to Shh rather than, or in addition to, a threshold concentration of Shh. This model for digit patterning depends upon continued Shh signaling in the posterior limb through mid-to-late bud stages. We find that cyclopamine, a potent antagonist of Shh signaling, can down-regulate hedgehog target genes in the posterior limb throughout the time Shh is expressed, indicating that continued active Shh signaling indeed takes place. To further explore the relative roles of time and concentration of Shh during limb development, we carried out two additional series of experiments. To test the effect of limiting the time, but not the amount of Shh produced, we treated chick embryos with the hedgehog antagonist cyclopamine at various stages of limb development. We find that short exposures to Shh result in specification of only the most anterior digits and that more posterior digits are specified sequentially with increasing times of uninterrupted Shh activity. To test the effect of limiting the level of Shh produced, but not the time of exposure, we genetically modified Shh production in mice. As previously shown, reducing both the concentration of Shh produced and the duration of Shh exposure results in a loss of posterior digits. We find that maintaining a low level of Shh production throughout the normal time frame of ZPA signaling results in a near complete restoration of the posterior-most digits. These data are consistent with, and lend additional support to, the model that concentration of Shh seen and duration of exposure both contribute to the dose-dependent specification of digit identities, but for the posterior-most digits the temporal component is the more critical parameter.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"17654705","pmcid":null,"title":"Expression of chick Fgf19 and mouse Fgf15 orthologs is regulated in the developing brain by Fgf8 and Shh.","authors":["Gimeno L","Martinez S"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists","journalShort":"Dev.

Here, we provide evidence that Shh promotes the proliferation and differentiation of primary cultures of chicken adult myoblasts (also termed satellite cells) and mouse myogenic C2 cells. These effects are reversed by cyclopamine, a specific chemical inhibitor of the Shh pathway. In addition, we show that Shh and its downstream molecules are expressed in adult myoblast cultures and localize adjacent to Pax7 in muscle sections. These gene expressions are regulated during postnatal muscle growth in chicks. Most importantly, we report that Shh induces MAPK/ERK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent Akt phosphorylation and that activation of both signaling pathways is essential for Shh's signaling in muscle cells. However, the effect of Shh on Akt phosphorylation is more robust than that on MAPK/ERK, and data suggest that Shh influences these pathways in a manner similar to IGF-I. By exploiting specific chemical inhibitors of the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways, UO126 and Ly294002, respectively, we demonstrate that Shh-induced Akt phosphorylation, but not that of MAPK/ERK, is required for its promotive effects on muscle cell proliferation and differentiation.

We show that Bmp2 expression correlates with upper spinal neurulation (in which DLHPs are absent); that Bmp2-null embryos exhibit premature, exaggerated DLHPs; and that the local release of Bmp2 inhibits neural fold bending.

The local release of Shh suppresses dorsal noggin expression, explaining the absence of DLHPs at high spinal levels, where notochordal expression of Shh is strong.

Shh increased the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and protein kinase C (PKC) activity. We show that the Shh-induced increase in the Gli1 mRNA level requires [Ca(2+)](i) and PKC. Shh increased the phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is blocked by the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor. Subsequently, Shh increased the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB p65 phosphorylation, which was inhibited by blocking PKC and EGFR tyrosine kinase. Shh also increased the level of the cell cycle regulatory proteins in a dose-dependent manner. However, Shh decreased the levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitory proteins.

Barx1 is expressed selectively in fetal stomach mesenchyme and directs differentiation of overlying endoderm. Recombinant tissue cultures and study of young mouse embryos previously suggested that Barx1 controls expression of secreted Wnt antagonists, which suppress endodermal Wnt signaling, to enable stomach epithelial differentiation. We overcame mid-gestational lethality of Barx1(-/-) mouse embryos and report here the spectrum of anomalies in a distinctive and unprecedented model of gastrointestinal homeotic transformation. Using various mouse models, we confirm the importance of attenuated Wnt signaling in stomach development and the role of Barx1 in suppressing endodermal Wnt activity. Absence of Barx1 also results in fully penetrant defects in positioning and expansion of the spleen, an organ that originates within the mesothelial lining of the stomach. Barx1 is absent from the spleen primordium but highly expressed in the mesogastrium, indicating an indirect effect on spleen development. However, our results argue against a role for Wnt antagonism in genesis of the spleen. Mouse spleen development relies on several homeodomain transcriptional regulators that are expressed in the spleen primordium. Loss of Barx1 does not affect expression of any of these genes but notably reduces expression of Wt1, a transcription factor implicated in spleen morphogenesis and expressed in the mesothelium. These observations place Barx1 proximally within a Wt1 pathway of spleen development and reveal how a homeotic regulator employs different molecular mechanisms to mold neighboring organs.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"17884337","pmcid":null,"title":"Sonic hedgehog induces transcription-independent cytoskeletal rearrangement and migration regulated by arachidonate metabolites.","authors":["Bijlsma MF","Borensztajn KS","Roelink H","Peppelenbosch MP","Spek CA"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Cellular signalling","journalShort":"Cell.

Here we report a critical role for SMRT in forebrain development and in maintenance of the neural stem cell state. Analysis of a series of markers in SMRT-gene-deleted mice revealed the functional requirement of SMRT in the actions of both retinoic-acid-dependent and Notch-dependent forebrain development. In isolated cortical progenitor cells, SMRT was critical for preventing retinoic-acid-receptor-dependent induction of differentiation along a neuronal pathway in the absence of any ligand.

We found that the forkhead transcription factor Foxa2, acting in progenitors, is essential for the transition from VMN to serotonergic neurogenesis.

This axon patterning defect correlates to the histological absence of the mesenchymal dental follicle and adjacent Semaphorin3A-free dental follicle target field as well as appearance of ectopic Sema3A expression domain in the lingual side of the epithelial bud. Although the mesenchymal ligands for Fgfr2b, Fgf3 and -10 were present in the Fgfr2b(-/)(-) dental mesenchyme, mutant dental epithelium showed dramatically reduced proliferation and the lack of Fgf3.

Optical projection tomography (OPT) is a new, rapid and non-invasive technique for three-dimensional (3D) imaging of small biological tissue specimens that allows visualization of the tissue distribution of RNA in developing organs while also recording morphology. To explore the application of OPT in this context, we visualized Shh and Foxf1 gene expression patterns in the mouse foregut and lung buds at several stages of development. Time-mated CBA/Ca mice were harvested on embryonic days 9-12. The embryos were stained following whole mount in situ hybridization with labelled RNA probes to detect Shh and Foxf1 transcripts at each stage. The embryos were scanned by OPT to obtain 3D representations of gene expression domains in the context of the changing morphology of the embryo. OPT analysis of Shh and Foxf1 expression in the foregut and lung buds revealed extra details of the patterns not previously reported, particularly in the case of Foxf1 where gene expression was revealed in a changing pattern in the mesenchyme around the developing lung. Shh expression was also revealed in the epithelium of the lung bud itself. Both genes were detected in complementary patterns in the developing bronchi as late as E12, showing successful penetration of molecular probes and imaging at later stages. OPT is a valuable tool for revealing gene expression in an anatomical context even in internal tissues like the foregut and lung buds across stages of development, at least until E12.

We investigate the interplay in these processes of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), fibroblast growth factors (Fgfs), and the transcription factor Gli3, which in its repressor form (Gli3R) antagonizes Shh signaling and downregulates expression of several Fgf genes. Contrary to previous reports, Shh is not required for dorsal hemisphere separation. Mice lacking Shh develop a dorsal telencephalic midline, a cortical hem, and two cortical hemispheres. The hemispheres do not divide rostrally, probably because of reduced local Fgf gene expression, resulting from the loss of Shh inhibition of Gli3R. Removing one functional copy of Gli3 substantially rescues Fgf expression and rostral telencephalic morphology. In mice lacking Gli3 function, cortical development is arrested, and ventral gene expression invades the dorsal telencephalon. These defects are potentially explained by disinhibition of Shh activity. However, when both copies of Shh are removed from Gli3-null mice, dorsal telencephalic defects persist. One such defect is a large dorsal expansion of the expression of Fgf genes. Fgf15 expression, for example, expands from a discrete ventral domain throughout the dorsal telencephalon. We propose that Fgf signaling, known to ventralize the telencephalon in a Shh-independent manner, suppresses cortical fate in the absence of Gli3. Our findings point away from Shh involvement in dorsal telencephalic patterning and encourage additional exploration of Fgf signaling and Gli3 repression in corticogenesis.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"18022614","pmcid":null,"title":"Wnt/beta-catenin signaling directs multiple stages of tooth morphogenesis.","authors":["Liu F","Chu EY","Watt B","Zhang Y","Gallant NM","Andl T","Yang SH","Lu MM","Piccolo S","Schmidt-Ullrich R","Taketo MM","Morrisey EE","Atit R","Dlugosz AA","Millar SE"],"grantIds":["R01 AR045973","R01 AR045973-08","R01 AR047709","R01 AR047709-01","R01 AR047709-02","R01 AR047709-03","R01 AR047709-03S1","R01 AR047709-04","R01 AR047709-05","R01 AR047709-05S1","R01 AR047709-06","R01 AR047709-07","R01 DE015342","R01 DE015342-01A2","R01 DE015342-02","R01 DE015342-03","R01 DE015342-04","R01 DE018470","R01 DE018470-02","R01 HD053829","R01 HD053829-01A1","R01-AR055241","R01-AR47709","R01-DE015342","R01-HD053829","T32-AR007465"],"grantAgencies":["NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIDCR NIH HHS","NIDCR NIH HHS","NIDCR NIH HHS","NIDCR NIH HHS","NIDCR NIH HHS","NIDCR NIH HHS","NIDCR NIH HHS","NICHD NIH HHS","NICHD NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS","NIDCR NIH HHS","NICHD NIH HHS","NIAMS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Developmental biology","journalShort":"Dev.

To investigate the functional significance of Smad4 in regulating CNC cells, we generated mice with neural crest specific inactivation of the Smad4 gene. Our study shows that Smad4 is not required for the migration of CNC cells, but is required in neural crest cells for the development of the cardiac outflow tract. Smad4 is essential in mediating BMP signaling in the CNC-derived ectomesenchyme during early stages of tooth development because conditional inactivation of Smad4 in neural crest derived cells results in incisor and molar development arrested at the dental lamina stage. Furthermore, Smad-mediated TGF-beta/BMP signaling controls the homeobox gene patterning of oral/aboral and proximal/distal domains within the first branchial arch. At the cellular level, a Smad4-mediated downstream target gene(s) is required for the survival of CNC cells in the proximal domain of the first branchial arch. Smad4 mutant mice show underdevelopment of the first branchial arch and midline fusion defects.

To investigate the relation between Cripto and Nodal in the early mouse embryo, we removed the Nodal antagonist Cerberus 1 (Cer1) and simultaneously Cripto, by generating Cer1;Cripto double mouse mutants.

We previously identified epiprofin (Epfn), a gene preferentially expressed in dental epithelia, differentiated ameloblasts, and certain ectodermal organs. To identify the role of Epfn in tooth development, we created Epfn-deficient mice (Epfn-/-). Epfn-/- mice developed an excess number of teeth, enamel deficiency, defects in cusp and root formation, and abnormal dentin structure. Mutant tooth germs formed multiple dental epithelial buds into the mesenchyme. In Epfn-/- molars, rapid proliferation and differentiation of the inner dental epithelium were inhibited, and the dental epithelium retained the progenitor phenotype. Formation of the enamel knot, a signaling center for cusps, whose cells differentiate from the dental epithelium, was also inhibited. However, multiple premature nonproliferating enamel knot-like structures were formed ectopically. These dental epithelial abnormalities were accompanied by dysregulation of Lef-1, which is required for the normal transition from the bud to cap stage. Transfection of an Epfn vector promoted dental epithelial cell differentiation into ameloblasts and activated promoter activity of the enamel matrix ameloblastin gene. Our results suggest that in Epfn-deficient teeth, ectopic nonproliferating regions likely bud off from the self-renewable dental epithelium, form multiple branches, and eventually develop into supernumerary teeth. Thus, Epfn has multiple functions for cell fate determination of the dental epithelium by regulating both proliferation and differentiation, preventing continuous tooth budding and generation.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"18233958","pmcid":null,"title":"Reduced BMP4 abundance in Gata2 hypomorphic mutant mice result in uropathies resembling human CAKUT.","authors":["Hoshino T","Shimizu R","Ohmori S","Nagano M","Pan X","Ohneda O","Khandekar M","Yamamoto M","Lim KC","Engel JD"],"grantIds":["GM28896"],"grantAgencies":["NIGMS NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms","journalShort":"Genes Cells","day":31,"month":2,"year":2008,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Animals, Newborn","Base Sequence","Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4","Bone Morphogenetic Proteins","DNA Primers","Disease Models, Animal","Female","GATA2 Transcription Factor","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Heterozygote","Humans","Introns","Male","Mice","Mice, Inbred C57BL","Mice, Knockout","Mice, Mutant Strains","Models, Biological","Phenotype","Pregnancy","RNA, Messenger","Transcription, Genetic","Transcriptional Activation","Urogenital Abnormalities","Urogenital System"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"Constitutive loss of transcription factor GATA-2 leads to embryonic lethality from primitive erythropoietic failure.

Mutations in the long-distant, limb-specific cis-regulator for SHH, called the ZRS, are responsible for the ectopic expression which underlies the abnormality. Here, we show that populations of domestic cats which manifest extra digits, including the celebrated polydactylous Hemingway's cats, also contain mutations within the ZRS. The polydactylous cats add significantly to the number of mutations previously reported in mouse and human and to date, all are single nucleotide substitutions. A mouse transgenic assay shows that these single nucleotide substitutions operate as gain-of-function mutations that activate Shh expression at an ectopic embryonic site; and that the sequence context of the mutation is responsible for a variable regulatory output. The plasticity of the regulatory response correlates with both the phenotypic variability and with species differences. The polydactyly mutations define a new genetic mechanism that results in human congenital abnormalities and identifies a pathogenetic mechanism that may underlie other congenital diseases.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"18171685","pmcid":null,"title":"Pivotal roles for eomesodermin during axis formation, epithelium-to-mesenchyme transition and endoderm specification in the mouse.","authors":["Arnold SJ","Hofmann UK","Bikoff EK","Robertson EJ"],"grantIds":["059312"],"grantAgencies":["Wellcome Trust","Wellcome Trust"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Development (Cambridge, England)","journalShort":"Development","day":14,"month":2,"year":2008,"meshHeadings":["Alleles","Animals","Body Patterning","Cadherins","Cell Movement","Down-Regulation","Embryo Loss","Embryo, Mammalian","Endoderm","Epithelium","Gastrulation","Gene Deletion","Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental","Germ Layers","Heterozygote","Integrases","Mesoderm","Mice","Models, Biological","Mutation","Nodal Protein","T-Box Domain Proteins","Transforming Growth Factor beta"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"The T-box transcription factor eomesodermin (Eomes) has been implicated as an important component in germ layer induction and patterning in vertebrate embryos.

The information obtained through this initiative is anticipated to enable the highest level of basic and clinical research grounded on a 21st-century view of the developing anatomy. There are three components to the Genitourinary Developmental Molecular Anatomy Project GUDMAP; all of these are intended to provide resources that support research on the kidney and UGT.

The second generates novel mouse strains. In these strains, cell types of particular interest within an organ are labeled through the introduction of a specific marker into the context of a gene that exhibits appropriate cell type or structure-specific expression. In addition, the targeting construct enables genetic manipulation within the cell of interest in many of the strains. Finally, the information is annotated, collated, and promptly released at regular intervals, before publication, through a database that is accessed through a Web portal. Presented here is a brief overview of the Genitourinary Developmental Molecular Anatomy Project effort.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"18292210","pmcid":null,"title":"Leukotriene synthesis is required for hedgehog-dependent neurite projection in neuralized embryoid bodies but not for motor neuron differentiation.","authors":["Bijlsma MF","Peppelenbosch MP","Spek CA","Roelink H"],"grantIds":["1R01-HD042307"],"grantAgencies":["NICHD NIH HHS"],"retractions":[],"journal":"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)","journalShort":"Stem Cells","day":30,"month":5,"year":2008,"meshHeadings":["Animals","Arachidonic Acid","Cell Differentiation","Embryo, Mammalian","Enzyme Inhibitors","Hedgehog Proteins","In Vitro Techniques","Indoles","Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors","Leukotrienes","Lipoxygenase Inhibitors","Mice","Motor Neurons","Neurites","Quail","Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled","Tubulin"],"hasAbstract":true,"score":0,"snippets":[],"abstract":"The hedgehog (Hh) pathway is required for many developmental processes, as well as for adult homeostasis. Although all known effects of Hh signaling affecting patterning and differentiation are mediated by members of the Gli family of zinc finger transcription factors, we demonstrate that the Hh-dependent formation of neurites from motor neurons, like migration of fibroblasts, requires leukotriene synthesis and is different from the Gli-mediated Hh response. Smoothened activity is required for the use of the leukotriene metabolism, and inversely, the leukotriene metabolism is required for mediating the Hh effects on neurite projection. These data establish a function for the previously described arachidonic acid-dependent Hh pathway in a developmentally relevant model system.","affiliation":[]},{"pmid":"18265010","pmcid":null,"title":"The incomplete inactivation of Fgf8 in the limb ectoderm affects the morphogenesis of the anterior autopod through BMP-mediated cell death.","authors":["Delgado I","Domínguez-Frutos E","Schimmang T","Ros MA"],"grantIds":[],"grantAgencies":[],"retractions":[],"journal":"Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists","journalShort":"Dev.

This line drives variable mosaic recombination of a floxed Fgf8 allele, resulting in a small proportion of AER cells that maintain Fgf8 expression. The phenotype of Mox2Cre;Fgf8 limbs is most similar to that of Msx2Cre;Fgf8 forelimbs, indicating that a small but durable expression of FGF8 is equivalent to an early normal, but transitory, expression. This functional equivalence likely relies on the subsequent Fgf4 upregulation that buffers the differences in the pattern of Fgf8 expression between the two conditional mutants. The molecular analysis of Mox2Cre;Fgf8 limbs shows that, despite Fgf4 upregulation, they develop under reduced FGF signaling. These limbs also exhibit an abnormal area of cell death at the anterior forelimb autopod, overlapping with an ectopic domain of Bmp7 expression, which can explain the abnormal morphogenesis of the anterior autopod.","affiliation":[]}]}
