                <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>
                    This site is driven by APIs built on top of the Monarch
                    infrastructure. In particular,
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>NIF OntoQuest</b> for ontology queries </li>
                        <li><b>NIF Federation Queries</b> for data resources </li>
                        <li><b>OwlSim</b> for semantic similarity</li>
                    </ul>
                    The monarch API is layered on top of these services. It is
                    written in javascript, and can be executed in a browser or
                    server environment. See <a href="/docs/index.html">the API
                    docs</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The web browser is written using the JSGI javascript
                    framework, implemented using RingoJS/stick. See the github
                    project page for details.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The Monarch API makes use of resources ingested into the
                    NIF DISCO system as part of the Monarch project. These
                    include Human Phenotype Ontology annotations (many done as
                    part of the NIH PATO project) and computational analyses
                    run using the OWLSim/PhenoDigm system.
                    </p>
                <h3>RESTful URLs</h3>
                    <p>
                    See <a href="services">Monarch Services</a> documentation.
                    </p>
                <h3>System Architecture</h3>
                    <p>
                    <img src="/image/architecture.png"/>
                    A typical URL is resolved as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>webapp.js matches the URL pattern against all registered patterns
                        (see <a href="services">services</a>). This typically results in a call to
                        the <a href="/docs/files/api-js.html">JS API</a>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        The JS API will issue one or more calls to other
                        services and aggregate the results. For federation
                        queries, a transformer is applied on each resource to
                        transform the tabular results into nested json objects
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        If the user requested json, webapp will return the
                        json object directly.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        If the user requested html, webapp will pass the json
                        through the relevant mustche template to return html.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                <h3>Installing Locally</h3>
                    <p>
                    It is very easy to install the web application
                    locally. Assuming you have git installed, clone the
                    project (see link in menubar above), run the install
                    script, and then run the start-server script. That's it!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    If you wish to make changes, see the README.md and
                    README-developers.md. You can either fork the project and
                    push changes, or simply ask to have your github account
                    added to the list of project members. See the guthub docs
                    for more details.
